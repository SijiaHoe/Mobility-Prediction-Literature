AB In taxicab industry, a long standing challenge is how to reduce
   taxicab's mileage spent without a fare, i.e., cruising mile. The current
   solution for this challenge usually requires the participation of the
   passengers. To solve the issue without the passengers involved, in this
   paper, we propose a cruising system, pCruise, for taxicab drivers to
   maximize theirs profits by finding the optimal route to pick up a
   passenger, thus reducing the cruising mile. In pCruise, base on
   collected GPS records about other near taxicabs, a taxicab characterizes
   its cruising process with a cruising graph. When a taxicab becomes
   vacant and tries to find a passenger, cruising graph will provide the
   shortest cruising route with at least one expected available passengers
   for this taxicab. With the shortest cruising routes, taxicabs will
   significantly reduce theirs cruising miles. We evaluate pCruise based on
   a 7 days 10 GB real world GPS dataset from a city with more than 15, 000
   taxicabs. The evaluation results show that pCruise can assist taxicab
   drivers to reduce cruising miles by 41% on average.

AB Data about people movement is nowadays easy to collect by GPS technology
   embedded in smartphones. GPS routes provide information about position,
   time and speed, but further conclusion requires either prior information
   or data analysis. We propose a method to detect the movement type by
   segmentation of the GPS route using speed, direction and their
   derivatives, and by applying an inference algorithm via a second order
   Markov model. The method is able to classify most typical moving types
   such as motor vehicle, bicycle, run, walk and stop.

AB Determining breast density in mammograms is important both in diagnostic
   and computer-aided detection applications. Knowing the right breast
   density and having knowledge of changes in breast density could give a
   hint of a process which started to happen in a patient. Mammograms are
   projection images and suffer from problem of overlapping tissue which
   results in possibility of inaccurate detection of tissue types. The main
   problem is the fibroglandular tissue which has rather high attenuation
   of x-rays and is visible as brighter area in the resulting image. Small
   blood vessels are usually the most common interfering objects in
   mammograms. In this paper we try to suppress scattered structures which
   do not represent glandular or dense tissue in order to divide mammograms
   more accurately in two major tissue types, fatty and dense tissue. For
   suppressing blood vessels we have used Gabor filters of different size
   and orientation to detect edges of blood vessels and subtract them from
   the original image. Obtained results show much more homogenous areas
   which could be used for easier discrimination between tissue types.

AB Practice shows that Answer Set Supported Double State-based Business
   Process Description Model (ASDSBPDM) better fits the need of incomplete
   process representation and nonmonotonic reasoning in e-government. This
   paper defines precisely the operational semantics of ASDSBPDM on the
   basis of Finite State Machine Theory, Logic Programming and Answer Set
   Semantics. We conclude that process forwarding is equivalent to
   continuous transition of its instance's configuration. Therefore it
   succeeds in discussing both business process and its operational
   semantics under the same framework (Finite State Machine), and helps to
   get a solid, theoretical foundation for further process analysis,
   tracking and mining in e-government.

AB The increasing availability of location-acquisition technologies (GPS,
   GSM networks, etc.) enables people to log the location histories with
   spatio-temporal data. Such real-world location histories imply, to some
   extent, users' interests in places, and bring us opportunities to
   understand the correlation between users and locations. In this article,
   we move towards this direction and report on a personalized friend and
   location recommender for the geographical information systems (GIS) on
   the Web. First, in this recommender system, a particular individual's
   visits to a geospatial region in the real world are used as their
   implicit ratings on that region. Second, we measure the similarity
   between users in terms of their location histories and recommend to each
   user a group of potential friends in a GIS community. Third, we estimate
   an individual's interests in a set of unvisited regions by involving
   his/her location history and those of other users. Some unvisited
   locations that might match their tastes can be recommended to the
   individual. A framework, referred to as a hierarchical-graph-based
   similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed to uniformly model each
   individual's location history, and effectively measure the similarity
   among users. In this framework, we take into account three factors: 1)
   the sequence property of people's outdoor movements, 2) the visited
   popularity of a geospatial region, and 3) the hierarchical property of
   geographic spaces. Further, we incorporated a content-based method into
   a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, which uses HGSM as the
   user similarity measure, to estimate the rating of a user on an item. We
   evaluated this recommender system based on the GPS data collected by 75
   subjects over a period of 1 year in the real world. As a result, HGSM
   outperforms related similarity measures, namely similarity-by-count,
   cosine similarity, and Pearson similarity measures. Moreover, beyond the
   item-based CF method and random recommendations, our system provides
   users with more attractive locations and better user experiences of
   recommendation.

AB Mobility data is becoming an important player in many application
   domains. Many techniques have been elaborated to extract statistical
   knowledge from the data sets gathering raw data tracks about the moving
   objects of interest to an application. These data tracks obey the
   physical-level specifications of the devices used for data acquisition
   (GPS, GSM, RFID, smart phones, and other sensors). Nowadays, interest
   has shifted from raw data tracks analysis to more application-oriented
   ways of analyzing more meaningful movement records suitable for the
   specific purposes of the application at hand. This trend has promoted
   the concept of semantically rich trajectories, rather than raw movement,
   as the core object of interest in mobility studies.
   This keynote paper intends to provide the foundations of a semantic
   approach to data about movement. It focuses on the definitions of the
   most important concepts about mobility data, concepts that are
   frequently used but rarely rigorously defined.

AB The advance of GPS-enabled devices allows people to record their
   location histories with GPS traces, which imply human behaviors and
   preferences related to travel. In this article, we perform two types of
   travel recommendations by mining multiple users' GPS traces. The first
   is a generic one that recommends a user with top interesting locations
   and travel sequences in a given geospatial region. The second is a
   personalized recommendation that provides an individual with locations
   matching her travel preferences. To achieve the first recommendation, we
   model multiple users' location histories with a tree-based hierarchical
   graph (TBHG). Based on the TBHG, we propose a HITS (Hypertext Induced
   Topic Search)-based model to infer the interest level of a location and
   a user's travel experience (knowledge). In the personalized
   recommendation, we first understand the correlation between locations,
   and then incorporate this correlation into a collaborative filtering
   (CF)-based model, which predicts a user's interests in an unvisited
   location based on her locations histories and that of others. We
   evaluated our system based on a real-world GPS trace dataset collected
   by 107 users over a period of one year. As a result, our HITS-based
   inference model outperformed baseline approaches like rank-by-count and
   rank-by-frequency. Meanwhile, we achieved a better performance in
   recommending travel sequences beyond baselines like rank-by-count.
   Regarding the personalized recommendation, our approach is more
   effective than the weighted Slope One algorithm with a slightly
   additional computation, and is more efficient than the Pearson
   correlation-based CF model with the similar effectiveness.

AB Traveling to unfamiliar regions require a significant effort from novice
   travelers to plan where to go within a limited duration. In this paper,
   we propose a smart recommendation for highly efficient and balanced
   itineraries based on multiple user-generated GPS trajectories. Users
   only need to provide a. minimal query composed of a start point, an end
   point and travel duration to receive an itinerary recommendation. To
   differentiate good itinerary candidates from less fulfilling ones, we
   describe how we model and define itinerary in terms of several
   characteristics mined from user-generated GPS trajectories. Further, we
   evaluated the efficiency of our method based on 17,745 user-generated
   GPS trajectories contributed by 125 users in Beijing, China. Also we
   performed a user study where current residents of Beijing used our
   system to review and give ratings to itineraries generated by our
   algorithm and baseline algorithms for comparison.
