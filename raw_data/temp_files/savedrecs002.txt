AB In recent years, the widespread of mobile devices has made easier and
   popular the activities of recording locations visited by users and of
   inferring their trajectories. The availability of such large amount of
   spatio-temporal data opens new challenges to automatically extract
   information and get valuable knowledge. The many aspects of this issue
   have aroused the interest of researchers in several areas, such as
   information retrieval, data mining, context-aware computing, security
   and privacy issues, urban planning, and transport management. Recently,
   there has been a strong interest in understanding how people move during
   their common daily activities in order to get information about their
   behaviors and habits. In this paper we describe considerable recent
   research works related to the analysis of mobile spatio-temporal data,
   focusing on the study of social habits and behaviors. We provide a
   general perspective on studies on human mobility by depicting and
   comparing methods and algorithms, highlighting some critical issues
   related to information extraction from spatio-temporal data, and future
   research directions.

AB Given increased access to a stream of data collected by location
   acquisition technologies, the potential of GPS trajectory data is
   waiting to be realized in various application domains relevant to urban
   informatics-namely in understanding travel behavior, estimating carbon
   emission from vehicles, and further building healthy and sustainable
   cities. Partitioning GPS trajectories into meaningful elements is
   crucial to improve the performance of further analysis. We propose a
   method for detecting a stay point (where an individual stays for a
   while) using a density-based spatial clustering algorithm where temporal
   criterion and gaps are also taken into account. The proposed method
   fills gaps using linear interpolation, and identifies a stay point that
   meets two criteria (spatial density and time duration). To evaluate the
   proposed method, we compare the number of stay points detected from the
   proposed method to that of stay points identified by manual inspection.
   Evaluation is performed on 9 weeks of trajectory data. Results show that
   clustering-based stay point detection combined with gap treatment can
   reliably detect stop episodes. Further, comparison of performance
   between using the method with versus without gap treatment indicates
   that gap treatment improves the performance of the clustering-based stay
   point detection.

AB Clustering is an efficient way to group data into different classes on
   basis of the internal and previously unknown schemes inherent of the
   data. With the development of the location based positioning devices,
   more and more moving objects are traced and their trajectories are
   recorded. Therefore, moving object trajectory clustering undoubtedly
   becomes the focus of the study in moving object data mining. To provide
   an overview, we survey and summarize the development and trend of moving
   object clustering and analyze typical moving object clustering
   algorithms presented in recent years. In this paper, we firstly
   summarize the strategies and implement processes of classical moving
   object clustering algorithms. Secondly, the measures which can determine
   the similarity/dissimilarity between two trajectories are discussed.
   Thirdly, the validation criteria are analyzed for evaluating the
   performance and efficiency of clustering algorithms. Finally, some
   application scenarios are point out for the potential application in
   future. It is hope that this research will serve as the steppingstone
   for those interested in advancing moving object mining.

AB Several algorithms have been proposed in the last years for discovering
   stops in trajectories of moving objects. Some methods consider as stops
   the sub trajectories that i) have speed lower than the average
   trajectory speed, ii) present significant direction changes, iii) have
   gaps, or iv) intersect a given spatial region. In these approaches a
   time constraint should be met for the subtrajectory to be considered as
   a stop, and this constraint is absolute (it is met or not). Indeed,
   these approaches consider stops as a continuous subtrajectory. In this
   paper, we show that for several application domains the stops do not
   need to be continuous, and the time constraint should be relaxed. In
   summary, we present the definitions of non -continuous stops and present
   an algorithm to discover a new kind of stops. We evaluate the proposed
   algorithm with a running example and real trajectory data, comparing it
   to the most similar approach in the literature, the SMoT algorithm.

AB The context in which a moving object moves contributes to the movement
   pattern observed. Likewise, the movement pattern reflects the properties
   of the movement context. In particular, big events influence human
   mobility depending on the dynamics of the events. However, this
   influence has not been explored to understand big events. In this paper,
   we propose a methodology for learning about big events from human
   mobility pattern. The methodology involves extracting and analysing the
   stopping, approaching, and moving-away interactions between public
   transportation vehicles and the geographic context. The analysis is
   carried out at two different temporal granularity levels to discover
   global and local patterns. The results of evaluating this methodology on
   bus trajectories demonstrate that it can discover occurrences of big
   events from mobility patterns, roughly estimate the event start and end
   time, and reveal the temporal patterns of arrival and departure of event
   attendees. This knowledge can be usefully applied in transportation and
   event planning and management.

AB Massive taxi trajectory data is exploited for knowledge discovery in
   transportation and urban planning. Existing tools typically require
   users to select and brush geospatial regions on a map when retrieving
   and exploring taxi trajectories and passenger trips. To answer seemingly
   simple questions such as "What were the taxi trips starting from Main
   Street and ending at Wall Street in the morning?" or "Where are the
   taxis arriving at the Art Museum at noon typically coming from?",
   tedious and time consuming interactions are usually needed since the
   numeric GPS points of trajectories are not directly linked to the
   keywords such as "Main Street", "Wall Street", and "Art Museum". In this
   paper, we present SemanticTraj, a new method for managing and
   visualizing taxi trajectory data in an intuitive, semantic rich, and
   efficient means. With SemanticTraj, domain and public users can find
   answers to the aforementioned questions easily through direct queries
   based on the terms. They can also interactively explore the retrieved
   data in visualizations enhanced by semantic information of the
   trajectories and trips. In particular, taxi trajectories are converted
   into taxi documents through a textualization transformation process.
   This process maps GPS points into a series of street/POI names and
   pick-up/drop-off locations. It also converts vehicle speeds into
   user-defined descriptive terms. Then, a corpus of taxi documents is
   formed and indexed to enable flexible semantic queries over a text
   search engine. Semantic labels and meta-summaries of the results are
   integrated with a set of visualizations in a SemanticTraj prototype,
   which helps users study taxi trajectories quickly and easily. A set of
   usage scenarios are presented to show the usability of the system. We
   also collected feedback from domain experts and conducted a preliminary
   user study to evaluate the visual system.

AB The wide adoption of location-enabled devices, together with the
   acceptance of services that leverage (personal) data as payment, allows
   scientists to push through some of the previous barriers imposed by data
   insufficiency, ethics and privacy skepticism. The research problems
   whose study require hard-to-obtain data (e.g. transportation mode
   detection, service contextualisation, etc.) have now become more
   accessible to scientists because of the availability of data collecting
   outlets. One such problem is the detection of a user's transportation
   mode. Different fields have approached the problem of transportation
   mode detection with different aims: Location-Based Services (LBS) is a
   field that focuses on understanding the transportation mode in
   real-time, Transportation Science is a field that focuses on measuring
   the daily travel patterns of individuals or groups of individuals, and
   Human Geography is a field that focuses on enriching a trajectory by
   adding domain-specific semantics. While different fields providing
   solutions to the same problem could be viewed as a positive outcome, it
   is difficult to compare these solutions because the reported performance
   indicators depend on the type of approach and its aim (e.g. the
   real-time availability of LBS requires the performance to be computed on
   each classified location). The contributions of this paper are three
   fold. First, the paper reviews the critical aspects desired by each
   research field when providing solutions to the transportation mode
   detection problem. Second, it proposes three dimensions that separate
   three branches of science based on their main interest. Finally, it
   identifies important gaps in research and future directions, that is,
   proposing: widely accepted error measures meaningful for all
   disciplines, methods robust to new data sets and a benchmark data set
   for performance validation.

AB The rapid growth of location-based services has motivated the
   development of continuous range queries in networks. Existing query
   algorithms usually adopt an expansion tree to reuse the previous query
   results to get better efficiency. However, the high maintenance costs of
   the traditional expansion tree lead to a sharp efficiency decrease. In
   this paper, we propose a line graph-based continuous range (LGCR) query
   algorithm for moving objects in networks, which is characterized by a
   novel graph-based expansion tree (GET) structure used to monitor queries
   in an incremental manner. In particular, GET is developed based on the
   line graph model of networks and simultaneously supports offline
   pre-computation to better adapt our proposed algorithm to different
   sizes of networks. To improve performance, we create a series of related
   data structures, such as bridgeable edges and distance edges.
   Correspondingly, we develop several algorithms, including
   initialization, insertion of objects, filter and refinement and location
   update, to incrementally re-evaluate continuous range queries. Finally,
   we implement the GET and related algorithms in the native graph database
   Neo4J. We conduct experiments using real-world networks and simulated
   moving objects and compare the proposed LGCR with the existing classical
   algorithm to verify its effectiveness and demonstrate its greater
   efficiency.

AB Tracking the spatio-temporal activity is highly relevant for domains
   like security, health, and quality management. Since animal welfare
   became a topic in politics and legislation locomotion patterns of
   livestock have received increasing interest. In contrast to the
   monitoring of pedestrians cattle activity tracking poses special
   challenges to both sensors and data analysis. Interesting states are not
   directly observable by a single sensor. In addition, sensors must be
   accepted by cattle and need to be robust enough to cope with a rough
   environment. In this article, we introduce the novel combination of
   heart rate and positioning sensors. Attached to neck and chest they are
   less interfering than accelerometers at the ankles. Exploiting the
   potential of such combined sensor system that records locomotion and
   non-spatial information from the heart rate sensor however is
   challenging. We introduce a novel two level method for the activity
   tracking focused on the duration and sequence of activity states. We
   combine Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Conditional Random Field (CRF)
   and extend Conditional Random fields by an explicit representation of
   duration. The SVM characterizes local activity states, whereas the CRF
   addresses sequences of local states to sequences incorporating spatial
   and non-spatial contextual knowledge. This combination provides a
   reliable and comprehensive identification of defined activity patterns,
   as well as their chronology and durations, suitable for the integration
   in an activity data base. This data base is used to extract
   physiological parameters and promises insights into internal states such
   as fitness, well-being and stress. Interestingly we were able to
   demonstrate a significant correlation between resting pulse rate and the
   day of pregnancy.

AB During the past few decades, a number of effective methods for indexing,
   query processing, and knowledge discovery in moving object databases
   have been proposed. An interesting research direction that has recently
   emerged handles semantics of movement instead of raw spatio-temporal
   data. Semantic annotations, such as "stop," "move," "at home,"
   "shopping," "driving," and so on, are either declared by the users
   (e.g., through social network apps) or automatically inferred by some
   annotation method and are typically presented as textual counterparts
   along with spatial and temporal information of raw trajectories. It is
   natural to argue that such "spatio-temporal-textual" sequences, called
   semantic trajectories, form a realistic representation model of the
   complex everyday life (hence, mobility) of individuals. Towards handling
   semantic trajectories of moving objects in Semantic Mobility Databases,
   the lack of real datasets leads to the need to design realistic
   simulators. In the context of the above discussion, the goal of this
   work is to realistically simulate the mobility life of a large-scale
   population of moving objects in an urban environment. Two simulator
   variations are presented: the core Hermoupolis simulator is parametric
   driven (i.e., user-defined parameters tune every movement aspect),
   whereas the expansion of the former, called Hermoupolisby-example,
   follows the generate-by-example paradigm and is self-tuned by looking
   inside a real small (sample) dataset. We stress test our proposal and
   demonstrate its novel characteristics with respect to related work.

AB Urban road traffic is highly dynamic. Traffic conditions vary in time
   and with location and so do the movement patterns of individual road
   users. In this article, a movement pattern is the behaviour of a car
   when traversing a road link in an urban road network. A movement pattern
   can be recorded with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), such
   as the Global Positioning System (GPS). A movement pattern has a
   specific energy-efficiency, which is a measure of how fuel-intensively
   the car is moving. For example, a car driving uniformly at medium speed
   consumes little fuel and, therefore, is energy-efficient, whereas
   stop-and-go driving consumes much fuel and is energy-inefficient. In
   this article we introduce a model to estimate the energy-efficiency of
   movement patterns in urban road traffic from GNSS data. First, we
   derived statistical features about the car's movement along the road.
   Then, we compared these to fuel consumption data from the car's
   controller area network (CAN) bus, normalized to the car's overall range
   of fuel consumption. We identified the optimal feature set for
   prediction. With the optimal feature set we trained, tested and verified
   a model to estimate energy-efficiency, with the fuel consumption serving
   as ground truth. Existing fuel consumption models usually view movement
   as a snapshot. Thus, the behaviour of the car remains unknown that
   causes a movement pattern to be energy-efficient or energy-inefficient.
   Our model views movement as a process and allows to interpret this
   process. A movement pattern can, for example, be energy-inefficient
   because the car is driving in stop-and-go traffic, because it is
   travelling at high speed, or because it is accelerating. Our model
   allows to distinguish between these different types of behaviours. Thus,
   it can provide new insights into the dynamics of urban road traffic and
   its energy-efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Timely identifying flight diversions is a crucial aspect of efficient
   multi-modal transportation. When an airplane diverts, logistics
   providers must promptly adapt their transportation plans in order to
   ensure proper delivery despite such an unexpected event. In practice,
   the different parties in a logistics chain do not exchange real-time
   information related to flights. This calls for a means to detect
   diversions that just requires publicly available data, thus being
   independent of the communication between different parties. The
   dependence on public data results in a challenge to detect anomalous
   behavior without knowing the planned flight trajectory.
   Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a prediction model that
   just requires information on an airplane's position, velocity, and
   intended destination. This information is used to distinguish between
   regular and anomalous behavior.
   When an airplane displays anomalous behavior for an extended period of
   time, the model predicts a diversion. A quantitative evaluation shows
   that this approach is able to detect diverting airplanes with excellent
   precision and recall even without knowing planned trajectories as
   required by related research. By utilizing the proposed prediction
   model, logistics companies gain a significant amount of response time
   for these cases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Current moving-object database (MOD) systems focus on management of

   between moving objects and spatial-temporal trajectories in an
   integrated manner. This paper combines moving-object database and social
   network systems and presents a novel data model called Geo-Social-Moving
   (GSM) that enables the unified management of trajectories, underlying
   geographical space and social relationships for mass moving objects. A
   bulk of user-defined data types and corresponding operators are also
   proposed to facilitate geo-social queries on moving objects. An
   implementation framework for the GSM model is proposed, and a prototype
   system based on native Neo4J is then developed with two real-world data
   sets from the location-based social network systems. Compared with
   solutions based on traditional extended relational database management
   systems characterized by time-consuming table join operations, the
   proposed GSM model characterized by graph traversal is argued to be more
   powerful in representing mass moving objects with social relationships,
   and more efficient and stable for geo-social querying.

AB Taxi trajectories reflect human mobility over a road network. Pick-up
   and drop-off locations in different time periods represent origins and
   destinations of trips, respectively, demonstrating the spatiotemporal
   characteristics of human behavior. Each trip can be viewed as a
   displacement in the random walk model, and the distribution of extracted
   trips shows a distance decay effect. To identify the spatial similarity
   of trips at a finer scale, this paper investigates the distribution of
   trips through topic modeling techniques. Firstly, trip origins and trip
   destinations were identified from raw GPS data. Then, different trips
   were given semantic information, i.e., link identification numbers with
   a semantic enrichment process. Each taxi trajectory was composed of a
   series of trip destinations corresponding to the same taxi.
   Subsequently, each taxi trajectory was analogous to a document
   consisting of different words, and all taxi's trajectories could be
   regarded as document corpora, enabling a semantic analysis of massive
   trip destinations. Finally, we obtained different trip destination
   topics reflecting the spatial similarity and regional property of human
   mobility through LDA topic model training. The effectiveness of this
   approach was illustrated by a case study using a large dataset of taxi
   trajectories collected from 2 to 8 June 2014 in Wuhan, China.

AB GPS trajectory dataset with high sampling-rates is usually in large
   volume that challenges the processing efficiency. Most of the data
   points on trajectories are useless. This paper summarizes trajectories
   using stop points. We define a new concept of stay stability (i.e., time
   dividing distance or reciprocal of speed) between any two GPS points to
   detect stop points on individual trajectories. We propose a novel Mining
   Repeat Travel Behaviors Using Stop Regions (MRTBUSR) method. In MRTBUSR,
   a stop region is a popular region containing a certain number of close
   stop points that can be grouped into a cluster. We then retrieve common
   sequences of stop regions to denote repeat route patterns and further
   analyze the stop durations on a stop region to find repeat travel
   behaviors. The experiments on 20 labeled trajectories selected from
   GeoLife demonstrated the semantic effect, accuracy and near linear
   efficiency of our proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB As an important factor for improving recommendations, time information
   has been introduced to model users' dynamic preferences in many papers.
   However, the sequence of users' behaviour is rarely studied in
   recommender systems. Due to the users' unique behavior evolution
   patterns and personalized interest transitions among items, users'
   similarity in sequential dimension should be introduced to further
   distinguish users' preferences and interests. In this paper, we propose
   a new collaborative filtering recommendation method based on users'
   interest sequences (IS) that rank users' ratings or other online
   behaviors according to the timestamps when they occurred. This method
   extracts the semantics hidden in the interest sequences by the length of
   users' longest common sub-IS (LCSIS) and the count of users' total
   common sub-IS (ACSIS). Then, these semantics are utilized to obtain
   users' IS-based similarities and, further, to refine the similarities
   acquired from traditional collaborative filtering approaches. With these
   updated similarities, transition characteristics and dynamic evolution
   patterns of users' preferences are considered. Our new proposed method
   was compared with state-of-the-art time-aware collaborative filtering
   algorithms on datasets MovieLens, Flixster and Ciao. The experimental
   results validate that the proposed recommendation method is effective
   and outperforms several existing algorithms in the accuracy of rating
   prediction.

AB Partial migration is a crucial mobility pattern in animal ecology.
   Unlike complete migrations that take place when all the individuals in a
   population migrate with a clear separation of ranges, partial migrations
   are migrations that often follow modalities and times that vary from
   animal to animal. As a result the distinction between migratory and
   nonmigratory behavior becomes less defined. In this paper, we present an
   interdisciplinary effort geared to evaluate whether a recent time-aware,
   density-based clustering technique, called SeqScan, relying on the novel
   concept of object's presence can be effectively applied to the study of
   partial migrations. To that end, we propose an extended framework
   centered on SeqScan, comprising a noise model for the detection of
   fine-grained movement patterns, i.e. excursions and inter-cluster
   transitions, and an internal time-aware validity index, for clustering
   evaluation. Furthermore, we contrast SeqScan with a recent technique
   developed in the context of animal ecology and grounded on statistical
   methods. For the study, we use real trajectories from two large
   herbivorous species located in Bavaria. We argue that the classification
   capabilities of SeqScan are comparable to those of the reference method.
   Moreover, the SeqScan framework overcomes important limitations of more
   conventional techniques, offering, in particular, the opportunity of
   quantifying the mobility behavior of individuals.

AB Human mobility is important for understanding the evolution of size and
   structure of urban areas, the spatial distribution of facilities, and
   the provision of transportation services. Until recently, exploring
   human mobility in detail was challenging because data collection methods
   consisted of cumbersome manual travel surveys, space-time diaries, or
   interviews. The development of location-aware sensors has significantly
   altered the possibilities for acquiring detailed data on human
   movements. Although this has spurred many methodological developments in
   identifying human movement patterns, many of these methods operate
   solely from the analytical perspective and ignore the environmental
   context within which the movement takes place. In this paper we attempt
   to widen this view and present an integrated approach to the analysis of
   human mobility using a combination of volunteered GPS trajectories and
   contextual spatial information. We propose a new framework for the
   identification of dynamic (travel modes) and static (significant places)
   behaviour using trajectory segmentation, data mining, and
   spatio-temporal analysis. We are interested in examining if and how
   travel modes depend on the residential location, age, or gender of the
   tracked individuals. Further, we explore theorised 'third places', which
   are spaces beyond main locations (home/work) where individuals spend
   time to socialise. Can these places be identified from GPS traces? We
   evaluate our framework using a collection of trajectories from 205
   volunteers linked to contextual spatial information on the types of
   places visited and the transport routes they use. The result of this
   study is a contextually enriched data set that supports new
   possibilities for modelling human movement behaviour.

AB Most existing approaches aiming at measuring trajectory similarity are
   focused on two-dimensional sequences of points, called raw trajectories.
   However, recent proposals have used background geographic information
   and social media data to enrich these trajectories with a semantic
   dimension, giving rise to the concept of semantic trajectories. Only a
   few works have proposed similarity measures for semantic trajectories or
   multidimensional sequences, having limitations such as predefined weight
   of the dimensions, sensitivity to noise, tolerance for gaps with
   different sizes, and the prevalence of the worst dimension similarity.
   In this article we propose MSM, a novel similarity measure for
   multidimensional sequences that overcomes the aforementioned limitations
   by considering and weighting the similarity in all dimensions. MSM is
   evaluated through an extensive experimental study that, based on a seed
   trajectory, creates sets of semantic trajectories with controlled
   transformations to introduce different kinds and levels of
   dissimilarity. For each set, we compute the similarity between the seed
   and the transformed trajectories, using different measures. The results
   showed that MSM was more robust and efficient than related approaches in
   the domain of semantic trajectories.

AB Mobility diaries of a large number of people are needed for assessing
   transportation infrastructure and spatial development planning.
   Acquisition of personal mobility diaries through population surveys is a
   costly and error-prone endeavour. We examine an alternative approach to
   obtaining similar information from episodic digital traces of people's
   presence in various locations, which appear when people use their mobile
   devices for making phone calls, accessing the Internet or posting
   georeferenced contents (texts, photos or videos) in social media. Having
   episodic traces of a person over a long time period, it is possible to
   detect significant (repeatedly visited) personal places and identify
   them as home, work or place of social activities based on temporal
   patterns of a person's presence in these places. Such analysis, however,
   can lead to compromising personal privacy. We have investigated the
   feasibility of deriving place meanings and reconstructing personal
   mobility diaries while preserving the privacy of individuals whose data
   are analysed. We have devised a visual analytics approach and a set of
   supporting tools making such privacy-preserving analysis possible. The
   approach was tested in two case studies with publicly available data:
   simulated tracks from the VAST Challenge 2014 and real traces built from
   georeferenced Twitter posts.

AB Land use classification has benefited from the emerging big data, such
   as mobile phone records and taxi trajectories. Temporal activity
   variations derived from these data have been used to interpret and
   understand the land use of parcels from the perspective of social
   functions, complementing the outcome of traditional remote sensing
   methods. However, spatial interaction patterns between parcels, which
   could depict land uses from a perspective of connections, have rarely
   been examined and analysed. To leverage spatial interaction information
   contained in the above-mentioned massive data sets, we propose a novel
   unsupervised land use classification method with a new type of place
   signature. Based on the observation that spatial interaction patterns
   between places of two specific land uses are similar, the new place
   signature improves land use classification by trading off between
   aggregated temporal activity variations and detailed spatial
   interactions among places. The method is validated with a case study
   using taxi trip data from Shanghai.

AB Global navigation satellite systems such as the Global Positioning
   System (GPS) is one of the most important sensors for movement analysis.
   GPS is widely used to record the trajectories of vehicles, animals and
   human beings. However, all GPS movement data are affected by both
   measurement and interpolation errors. In this article we show that
   measurement error causes a systematic bias in distances recorded with a
   GPS; the distance between two points recorded with a GPS is - on average
   - bigger than the true distance between these points. This systematic
   overestimation of distance' becomes relevant if the influence of
   interpolation error can be neglected, which in practice is the case for
   movement sampled at high frequencies. We provide a mathematical
   explanation of this phenomenon and illustrate that it functionally
   depends on the autocorrelation of GPS measurement error (C). We argue
   that C can be interpreted as a quality measure for movement data
   recorded with a GPS. If there is a strong autocorrelation between any
   two consecutive position estimates, they have very similar error. This
   error cancels out when average speed, distance or direction is
   calculated along the trajectory. Based on our theoretical findings we
   introduce a novel approach to determine C in real-world GPS movement
   data sampled at high frequencies. We apply our approach to pedestrian
   trajectories and car trajectories. We found that the measurement error
   in the data was strongly spatially and temporally autocorrelated and
   give a quality estimate of the data. Most importantly, our findings are
   not limited to GPS alone. The systematic bias and its implications are
   bound to occur in any movement data collected with absolute positioning
   if interpolation error can be neglected.

AB With the development of GPS and the popularity of smart phones and
   wearable devices, users can easily log their daily trajectories. Prior
   works have elaborated on mining trajectory patterns from raw
   trajectories. Trajectory patterns consist of hot regions and the
   sequential relationships among them, where hot regions refer the spatial
   regions with a higher density of data points. Note that some hot regions
   do not have any meaning for users. Moreover, trajectory patterns do not
   have explicit time information or semantic information. To enrich
   trajectory patterns, we propose semantic trajectory patterns which are
   referred to as the moving patterns with spatial, temporal, and semantic
   attributes. Given a user trajectory, we aim at mining frequent semantic
   trajectory patterns. Explicitly, we extract the three attributes from a
   raw trajectory, and convert it into a semantic mobility sequence. Given
   such a semantic mobility sequence, we propose two algorithms to discover
   frequent semantic trajectory patterns. The first algorithm, MB (standing
   for matching-based algorithm), is a naive method to find frequent
   semantic trajectory patterns. It generates all possible patterns and
   extracts the occurrence of the patterns from the semantic mobility
   sequence. The second algorithm, PS (standing for PrefixSpan-based
   algorithm), is developed to efficiently mine semantic trajectory
   patterns. Due to the good efficiency of PrefixSpan, algorithm PS will
   fully utilize the advantage of PrefixSpan. Since the semantic mobility
   sequence contains three attributes, we need to further transform it into
   a raw sequence before using algorithm PrefixSpan. Therefore, we propose
   the SS algorithm (standing for sequence symbolization algorithm) to
   achieve this purpose. To evaluate our proposed algorithms, we conducted
   experiments on the real datasets of Google Location History, and the
   experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our
   proposed algorithms.

AB Floating car data (FCD) recorded with the Global Positioning System
   (GPS) are an important data source for traffic research. However, FCD
   are subject to error, which can relate either to the accuracy of the
   recordings (measurement error) or to the temporal rate at which the data
   are sampled (interpolation error). Both errors affect movement
   parameters derived from the FCD, such as speed or direction, and
   consequently influence conclusions drawn about the movement. In this
   paper we combined recent findings about the autocorrelation of GPS
   measurement error and well-established findings from random walk theory
   to analyse a set of real-world FCD. First, we showed that the
   measurement error in the FCD was affected by positive autocorrelation.
   We explained why this is a quality measure of the data. Second, we
   evaluated four metrics to assess the influence of interpolation error.
   We found that interpolation error strongly affects the correct
   interpretation of the car's dynamics (speed, direction), whereas its
   impact on the path (travelled distance, spatial location) was moderate.
   Based on these results we gave recommendations for recording of FCD
   using the GPS. Our recommendations only concern time-based sampling,
   change-based, location-based or event-based sampling are not discussed.
   The sampling approach minimizes the effects of error on movement
   parameters while avoiding the collection of redundant information. This
   is crucial for obtaining reliable results from FCD.

   transportation mode segmentation. To address these problems, this paper
   proposes new error measures that can be applied to measure how well a
   continuous transportation mode segmentation model performs. The error
   measures introduced are based on aligning multiple inferred continuous
   intervals to ground truth intervals, and measure the cardinality of the
   alignment and the spatial and temporal discrepancy between the
   corresponding aligned segments. The utility of this new way of computing
   errors is shown by evaluating the segmentation of three generic
   transportation mode segmentation approaches (implicit,
   explicit-holistic, and explicit-consensus-based transport mode
   segmentation), which can be implemented in a thick client architecture.
   Empirical evaluations on a large real-word data set reveal the
   superiority of explicit-consensus-based transport mode segmentation,
   which can be attributed to the explicit modeling of segments and
   transitions, which allows for a meaningful decomposition of the complex
   learning task.

AB Social media data with geotags can be used to track people's movements
   in their daily lives. By providing both rich text and movement
   information, visual analysis on social media data can be both
   interesting and challenging. In contrast to traditional movement data,
   the sparseness and irregularity of social media data increase the
   difficulty of extracting movement patterns. To facilitate the
   understanding of people's movements, we present an interactive visual
   analytics system to support the exploration of sparsely sampled
   trajectory data from social media. We propose a heuristic model to
   reduce the uncertainty caused by the nature of social media data. In the
   proposed system, users can filter and select reliable data from each
   derived movement category, based on the guidance of uncertainty model
   and interactive selection tools. By iteratively analyzing filtered
   movements, users can explore the semantics of movements, including the
   transportation methods, frequent visiting sequences and keyword
   descriptions. We provide two cases to demonstrate how our system can
   help users to explore the movement patterns.

AB The dynamics of urban activities in Jerusalem were studied by analyzing
   a large-scale semantically rich movement dataset. The semantic
   enrichment process was based on coupling movement trajectories sampled
   by GPS loggers with contextual data derived from trajectory-based
   digital activity dairies. Although the utility of such procedures in
   generating trajectory-specific semantic data was noted before, their
   application stays limited. In this paper, we promote the utilization of
   these procedures by demonstrating that they are not only feasible but
   also important for mobility studies. We discuss the characteristics of
   the semantic enrichment process and the manner by which it was applied
   within the large-scale analysis of urban dynamics. This application
   uncovered a time- and context-dependent array of centers in Jerusalem,
   resulting in a semantically rich characterization of urban dynamics.
   Such characterization provides otherwise unobtainable insights crucial
   for urban analysis. Wider implications for movement studies may be
   derived, as this application demonstrates how diary-based enrichment
   approaches hold the potential to advance bridging the semantic gap in
   mobility research.

AB Aggregate nearest neighbor (ANN) search retrieves for two spatial
   datasets T and Q, segment(s) of one or more trajectories from the set T
   having minimum aggregate distance to points in Q. When interacting with
   large amounts of trajectories, this process would be very time-consuming
   due to consecutive page loads. An approximate method for finding
   segments with minimum aggregate distance is proposed which can improve
   the response time. In order to index large volumes of trajectories,
   scalable and efficient trajectory index (SETI) structure is used. But
   some refinements are provided to temporal index of SETI to improve the
   performance of proposed method. The experiments were performed with
   different number of query points and percentages of dataset. It is shown
   that proposed method besides having an acceptable precision, can reduce
   the computation time significantly. It is also shown that the main
   fraction of search time among load time, ANN and computing convex and
   centroid, is related to ANN.

   result, this paper presents CEP-traj, a novel middleware to ease the
   development of real-time trajectory-based services based on the Complex
   Event Processing (CEP) paradigm. By means of an event-based approach,
   the present middleware is able to detect a set of generic patterns along
   with meaningful changes of an entity's movement. In order to prove its
   suitability and feasibility, a vessel abnormal-behaviour detection
   system has been developed on the basis of the middleware's features.
   Finally, both synthetic and real datasets have been used to test the
   accuracy and performance of the middleware and the detection system
   implemented on top of the Esper engine. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB In recent years, many approaches have been developed that efficiently
   and effectively visualize movement data, e.g., by providing suitable
   aggregation strategies to reduce visual clutter. Analysts can use them
   to identify distinct movement patterns, such as trajectories with
   similar direction, form, length, and speed. However, less effort has
   been spent on finding the semantics behind movements, i.e. why somebody
   or something is moving. This can be of great value for different
   applications, such as product usage and consumer analysis, to better
   understand urban dynamics, and to improve situational awareness.
   Unfortunately, semantic information often gets lost when data is
   recorded. Thus, we suggest to enrich trajectory data with POI
   information using social media services and show how semantic insights
   can be gained. Furthermore, we show how to handle semantic uncertainties
   in time and space, which result from noisy, unprecise, and missing data,
   by introducing a POI decision model in combination with highly
   interactive visualizations. Finally, we evaluate our approach with two
   case studies on a large electric scooter data set and test our model on
   data with known ground truth.

AB The analysis of movements frequently requires more than just
   spatio-temporal data. Thus, despite recent progresses in trajectory
   handling, there is still a gap between movement data and formal
   semantics. This gap hinders movement analyses benefiting from available
   knowledge, with well-defined and widely agreed semantics. This article
   describes the Baquara(2) framework to help narrow this gap by exploiting
   knowledge bases to semantically enrich and analyze movement data. It
   provides an ontological model for structuring and abstracting movement
   data in a multilevel hierarchy of progressively detailed movement
   segments that generalize concepts such as trajectories, stops, and
   moves. Baquara(2) also includes a general customizable process to
   annotate movement data with concepts and objects described in ontologies
   and Linked Open Data (LOD) collections. The resulting semantic
   annotations enable queries for movement analyses based on application
   and domain specific knowledge. The proposed framework has been used in
   experiments to semantically enrich movement data collected from social
   media with geo-referenced LOD. The obtained results enable powerful
   queries that illustrate Baquara(2) capabilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The aging population is a major concern of human society in the 21st
   century. Elders who suffer physical or cognitive impairments often have
   difficulties in navigational tasks and remembering landmarks. As such,
   disorientation (i.e., getting lost) becomes common for people with
   dementia in unfamiliar or even in familiar environments. In order to
   provide appropriate real-time assistive services to these elders, such
   as reminders and alerts, we propose a disorientation detection method
   that detects outliers in one's GPS trajectories. In particular, we first
   model an individual's movement trajectories as a graph based on her
   historical GPS traces. We then identify outlying trajectories that have
   a defined wandering or deviating pattern as potential instances of
   disorientation. We develop a method called iBDD that is able to detect
   two categories of outlying trajectories in a uniform framework in
   real-time. Using ten individuals' real-world GPS datasets, we
   demonstrate that iBDD can achieve 95% detection rate of disorientation
   with less than 3% of false positives, based on properly chosen
   parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The emergence of cloud-based storage services is opening up new avenues
   in data exchange and data dissemination. This has amplified the interest
   in right-protection mechanisms to establish ownership in the event of
   data leakage. Current right-protection technologies, however, rarely
   provide strong guarantees on dataset utility after the protection
   process. This work presents techniques that explicitly address this
   topic and provably preserve the outcome of certain mining operations. In
   particular, we take special care to guarantee that the outcome of
   hierarchical clustering operations remains the same before and after
   right protection. Our approach considers all prevalent hierarchical
   clustering variants: single-, complete-, and average-linkage. We imprint
   the ownership in a dataset using watermarking principles, and we derive
   tight bounds on the expansion/contraction of distances incurred by the
   process. We leverage our analysis to design fast algorithms for right
   protection without exhaustively searching the vast design space.
   Finally, because the right-protection process introduces a user-tunable
   distortion on the dataset, we explore the possibility of using this
   mechanism for data obfuscation. We quantify the tradeoff between
   obfuscation and utility for spatiotemporal datasets and discover very
   favorable characteristics of the process. An additional advantage is
   that when one is interested in both right-protecting and obfuscating the
   original data values, the proposed mechanism can accomplish both tasks
   simultaneously.

AB Animal coordinated movement interactions are commonly explained by
   assuming unspecified social forces of attraction, repulsion and
   alignment with parameters drawn from observed movement data. Here we
   propose and test a biologically realistic and quantifiable biosonar
   movement interaction mechanism for echolocating bats based on spatial
   perceptual bias, i.e. actual sound field, a reaction delay, and observed
   motor constraints in speed and acceleration. We found that foraging
   pairs of bats flying over a water surface swapped leader-follower roles
   and performed chases or coordinated manoeuvres by copying the heading a
   nearby individual has had up to 500 ms earlier. Our proposed mechanism
   based on the interplay between sensory-motor constraints and delayed
   alignment was able to recreate the observed spatial actor-reactor
   patterns. Remarkably, when we varied model parameters (response delay,
   hearing threshold and echolocation directionality) beyond those observed
   in nature, the spatio-temporal interaction patterns created by the model
   only recreated the observed interactions, i.e. chases, and best matched
   the observed spatial patterns for just those response delays, hearing
   thresholds and echolocation directionalities found to be used by bats.
   This supports the validity of our sensory ecology approach of movement
   coordination, where interacting bats localise each other by active
   echolocation rather than eavesdropping.

AB Social Network has recently played a significant role in both scientific
   and social communities. The growing adoption of social network
   applications has been a relevant source of information nowadays. Due to
   its popularity, several research trends are emerged to service the huge
   volume of users including, Location Based Social Networks (LBSN),
   Recommendation Systems, Sentiment Analysis Applications, and many
   others. LBSNs applications are among the highly demanded applications
   that do not focus only on analyzing the spatio-temporal positions in a
   given raw trajectory but also on understanding the semantics behind the
   dynamics of the moving object. LBSNs are possible means of predicting
   human mobility based on users social ties as well as their spatial
   preferences. LBSNs rely on the efficient representation of users'
   trajectories. Hence, traditional raw trajectory information is no longer
   convenient. In our research we focus on studying human behavior
   trajectory which is the major pillar in location recommendation systems.
   In this paper we propose an ontology model with its underlying
   description logics to efficiently annotate human behavior trajectories.

AB College students with financial difficulties refer to those whose
   families can hardly afford their high tuition in universities, and
   should be supported by modern funding system. Indeed, students' economic
   plight negatively impact their mental health, academic performance, as
   well as their personal and social life. While funding students in

   inefficient, and such subjective judgements may not reflect the truth.
   To this end, in this paper, we explore the data mining techniques for
   identifying students who are qualified for financial support.
   Specifically, we investigate students' complex behaviors on campus from
   multiple perspectives, and develop a learning framework, named Dis-HARD,
   by jointly incorporating the heterogeneous features to predict the
   portfolio of stipends a given student should be awarded. Our framework
   formalizes the above problem as a multi-label learning problem. Along
   this line, we first extract discriminative features from three
   perspectives: (i) smartcard usage behavior, (ii) internet usage behavior
   and (iii) trajectory on campus. Then, we develop a linear loss function
   with regularization to solve this multi-label classification problem. In
   addition, to effectively exploit the students' similarity and label
   dependency, we incorporate the graph Laplacian and composite l(2,1)-norm
   into the regularization of our model, and develop a re-weighted
   algorithm to achieve effective optimization. Finally, experiments on
   real-world data demonstrate that our method consistently provides better
   performance compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB Geospatial datasets in the Linking Open Data (LOD) Cloud are rather of
   static nature and mainly consist of information such as a name, geo
   coordinates, an address, or opening hours. There is no linked dataset
   providing dynamic information about the ''popularity'' of certain places
   or the "visiting frequency" of users in specific contextual situations.
   This type of information within the WD Cloud, however, would enable a
   variety of new applications based on semantically enriched location
   analytics. In this paper, we present Linked Crowd-sourced Data as a
   dataset, which links real user location preferences (e.g., check-ins,
   ratings, or comments) as well as specific context situations (e.g.,
   weather conditions, holiday information, or measured networks) collected
   via crowdsourcing to static location data. We showcase the applicability
   of this dataset for location analytics use cases through a map
   visualization and highlight its added value with exemplary SPARQL
   queries that allow for location requests depending on historic context
   information.

AB With the development of GPS and the popularity of smart phones and
   wearable devices, users can easily log their daily trajectories. Prior
   works have elaborated on mining trajectory patterns from raw
   trajectories. However, trajectory patterns do not have explicit time
   information or semantic information. To enrich trajectory patterns, we
   propose STS-TPs (standing for Spatial-Temporal Semantic Trajectory
   Patterns) which refer to the moving patterns with spatial, temporal, and
   semantic attributes. Given a set of user trajectories, we aim at mining
   STS-TPs. Explicitly, we extract the three attributes from raw
   trajectories, and convert these trajectories into semantic trajectory
   sequences. Given a set of such semantic trajectory sequences, STS-TPs
   could be viewed as sequential patterns with multiple attributes. To
   fully explore the efficiency of PrefixSpan on sequential pattern mining,
   we propose a PrefixSpan-based algorithm (abbreviated as PS) to discover
   STS-TPs. Note that the input for PrefixSpan is a set of sequences
   consisting of items. However, each item of semantic trajectory sequences
   contains three attributes, and we need to further transform these
   sequences into symbolized sequences before using PrefixSpan. Therefore,
   we propose two algorithms of Sequence Symbolization (SS) and Advanced
   Sequence Symbolization (ASS) to achieve this purpose. In light of
   STS-TPs, we further propose query tasks to predict users' behaviors. To
   evaluate our proposed algorithms, we conducted experiments on the real
   datasets of Google Location History, and the experimental results show
   the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

AB In this paper, we study the problem of discovering all movement patterns
   from semantic trajectory databases. We propose a two-step method to
   solve this problem efficiently. We first retrieve frequent movement
   patterns of categories from the transformed database of sequential
   categories, and then cluster dense trajectories in a growth-type way for
   all movement patterns. Moreover, we define a new metric distance
   function on trajectories. We also use M-tree to cluster trajectories
   more efficiently. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of
   the proposed method.

AB There are diverse sensor applications built into different personal
   devices, which have the ability to record data related to various
   aspects of the user. With the ever increasing popularity and lowering
   costs of such personal devices such as Smart Phones, collecting data
   from the mobile sensors available in these devices becomes feasible. A
   wealth of information can be gleaned from such data collected from these
   sensors which reveals various aspects of the individual's behaviour and
   activity. Existing approaches for analyzing such data mainly focuses on
   inferring semantic context and detecting associations from such data.
   For example, GPS enabled devices allow users to record their movements
   in the form of spatio-temporal stream points, and meaningful information
   can be extracted based on different research objectives.
   In this paper, we have investigated a computation framework in order to
   identify users' activity categories and their event's associations from
   GPS trajectory data. This framework has several progressive stages and
   is designed based on different approaches in each stage, which will
   facilitate to analyse people's everyday lifestyles that are related to
   outdoor behaviours. Moreover, we have proposed an approach to improve
   the performance of the semantic annotation process of this framework, by
   combining different sources of mobile sensor data (i.e. GPS and audio
   data). The proposed framework and approaches have been validated on
   actual data sets which include the Microsoft's Geolife data set and a
   data set collected by ourselves.

AB There are always challenges of collecting, indexing and query processing
   of moving objects trajectories in the field of Moving Objects Databases
   (MODB). Trajectory data collected by location-aware devices are usually
   prone to different errors and in most situations indexing and query
   processing are performed on this erroneous data. As a result, responses
   provided for the queries that posed by various application scenarios of
   Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Location Based Services
   (LBS), have low accuracy, besides having significant time delay. In this
   paper, we proposed a model that, tries to reduce the errors of data
   using map-matching algorithms and index them by exploiting road network
   information. The indexing can be carried out on past and current
   movements separately. There is also a possibility of data reduction
   prior to indexing in order to improve the query processing performance,
   which attempts to reduce the volumes of data while keeping their quality
   acceptable for applications. Experiments show the improvement in
   accuracy and response time of different spatio-temporal queries. In
   addition, the effect of map-matching and data reduction on indexing
   methods are also studied.

AB The increasing availability of positioning data from mobile devices
   facilitates new opportunities for location analytics systems, which
   provide insights into the movement behavior of targets across various
   localities. Similar to web analytics systems, positioning data can be
   utilized to count, for example, returning visitors in venues, calculate
   visit frequencies for certain time intervals, or to identify typical
   movement paths for different groups of visitors inside and outside
   buildings. However, a major challenge for location analytics is still to
   deal with the heterogeneity of data from various positioning systems. In
   this paper we present a platform that enables location analytics as a
   service and copes with the heterogeneous spatiotemporal data of diverse
   accuracy, frequency, and coverage. Furthermore, it allows to query large
   positioning datasets according to various data dimensions and metrics.
   In an additional four-month field trial the applicability of our
   approach was reviewed using the example of WLAN positioning data from an
   office environment.

AB Trajectory data analysis has recently become an active research area.
   This is due to the large availability of mobile tracking sensors, such
   as GPS-enabled smart phones. However, those GPS trackers only provide
   raw trajectories (x, y, t), ignoring information about the activity,
   transportation mode, etc. This information can contribute in producing
   significant knowledge about movements, which transforms raw trajectories
   into semantic trajectories. Therefore, research lately has focused on
   semantic trajectories; their representation, construction, and
   applications. This paper investigates the current studies on semantic
   trajectories so far. We propose a new classification schema for the
   research efforts in semantic trajectory construction and applications.
   The proposed classification schema includes three main classes: semantic
   trajectory modeling, computation, and applications. Besides, we discuss
   the current research gaps found in this research area.
