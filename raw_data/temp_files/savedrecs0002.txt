   Recommender Systems for Citizens (CitRec'17), held at the 11th ACM
   Conference on Recommender Systems, in August 2017 in Como, Italy. We
   discuss challenges and opportunities for the development of recommender
   systems for citizens, including: the clarification of the role of
   recommender systems for cities and citizens; in this context, the
   identification of classes of items to be recommended; the need for
   targeting and engaging the right population, involving the right
   stakeholders; and the existence of underlying ethical issues such as
   fairness and consensus. We further provide an action plan to bring
   forward the research and application of recommender systems for
   citizens.

AB Advances in location acquisition and mobile technologies led to the
   addition of the location dimension to Social Networks (SNs) and to the
   emergence of a newer class called Location-Based Social Networks
   (LBSNs). While LBSNs are richer in their model and functions than SNs,
   they fail so far to attract as many users as SNs. On the other hand, SNs
   have large amounts of geo-tagged media that are under-utilized. In this
   paper, we propose an Interest-Aware Location-Based Recommender system
   (IALBR), which combines the advantages of both LBSNs and SNs, in order
   to provide interest-aware location-based recommendations. This
   recommender system is proposed as an extension to LBSNs. It is novel in:
   (1) utilizing the geo-content in both LBSNs and SNs; (2) ranking the
   recommendations based on a novel scoring method that maps to the user
   interests. It also works for passive users who are not active content
   contributors to the LBSN. This feature is critical to increase the
   number of LBSN users. Moreover, it helps with reducing the cold start
   problem, which is a common problem facing the new users of recommender
   systems who get random unsatisfying recommendations. This is due to the
   lack of user interest awareness, which is reliant on user history in
   most of the recommenders. We evaluated our system with a large-scale
   real dataset collected from foursquare with respect to precision, recall
   and the f-measure. We also compared the results with a ground truth
   system using metrics like the normalized discounted cumulative gain and
   the mean absolute error. The results confirm that the proposed IALBR
   generates more efficient recommendations than baselines in terms of
   interest awareness.

AB This article investigates how workout trajectories from a mobile sports
   tracking application can be used to provide automatic route suggestions
   for bicyclists. We apply a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based method for
   matching cycling tracks to a "bicycle network" extracted from
   crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, and evaluate its effective
   differences in terms of optimal routing compared with a simple geometric
   point-to-curve method. OSM has quickly established itself as a popular
   resource for bicycle routing; however, its high-level of detail presents
   challenges for its applicability to popularity-based routing. We propose
   a solution where bikeways are prioritized in map-matching, achieving
   good performance; the HMM-based method matched correctly on average 94%
   of the route length. In addition, we show that the extremely biased
   nature of the trajectory dataset, which is typical of volunteered
   user-generated data, can be of high importance in terms of
   popularity-based routing. Most computed routes diverged depending on
   whether the number of users or number of tracks was used as an indicator
   of popularity, which may imply varying preferences among different types
   of cyclists. Revising the number of tracks by diversity of users to
   surmount local biases in the data had a more limited effect on routing.

AB Exposing latent knowledge in geospatial trajectories has the potential
   to provide a better understanding of the movements of individuals and
   groups. Motivated by such a desire, this work presents the context tree,
   a new hierarchical data structure that summarises the context behind
   user actions in a single model. We propose a method for context tree
   construction that augments geospatial trajectories with land usage data
   to identify such contexts. Through evaluation of the construction method
   and analysis of the properties of generated context trees, we
   demonstrate the foundation for understanding and modelling behaviour
   afforded. Summarising user contexts into a single data structure gives
   easy access to information that would otherwise remain latent, providing
   the basis for better understanding and predicting the actions and
   behaviours of individuals and groups. Finally, we also present a method
   for pruning context trees for use in applications where it is desirable
   to reduce the size of the tree while retaining useful information.

AB Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an important means to
   help people discover attractive and interesting places, especially when
   users travel out of town. However, the extreme sparsity of a user-POI
   matrix creates a severe challenge. To cope with this challenge, we
   propose a unified probabilistic generative model, the Topic-Region Model
   (TRM), to simultaneously discover the semantic, temporal, and spatial
   patterns of users' check-in activities, and to model their joint effect
   on users' decision making for selection of POIs to visit. To demonstrate
   the applicability and flexibility of TRM, we investigate how it supports
   two recommendation scenarios in a unified way, that is, hometown
   recommendation and out-of- town recommendation. TRM effectively
   overcomes data sparsity by the complementarity and mutual enhancement of
   the diverse information associated with users' check-in activities
   (e.g., check-in content, time, and location) in the processes of
   discovering heterogeneous patterns and producing recommendations. To
   support real-time POI recommendations, we further extend the TRM model
   to an online learning model, TRM-Online, to track changing user
   interests and speed up the model training. In addition, based on the
   learned model, we propose a clustering-based branch and bound algorithm
   (CBB) to prune the POI search space and facilitate fast retrieval of the
   top-k recommendations.
   We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our
   proposals on two real-world datasets, including recommendation
   effectiveness, overcoming the cold-start problem, recommendation
   efficiency, and model-training efficiency. The experimental results
   demonstrate the superiority of our TRM models, especially TRM-Online,
   compared with state-of-the-art competitive methods, by making more
   effective and efficient mobile recommendations. In addition, we study
   the importance of each type of pattern in the two recommendation
   scenarios, respectively, and find that exploiting temporal patterns is
   most important for the hometown recommendation scenario, while the
   semantic patterns play a dominant role in improving the recommendation
   effectiveness for out-of-town users.

   systems cannot achieve the balanced relationship between supplements and
   demands over the resources. In this case, the uploading bandwidth of the

   degraded. In this paper, an adaptive resource scheduling mechanism
   called Push mechanism, is proposed, in which "proactive" strategies are
   provided to handle the unbalance supplement-demand relationship of some
   resource. Specifically, the system firstly forecasts which resource will
   becoming insufficient, then it pre-increase the uploaders over such
   resource so that the system performance is improved. Through numerical
   practical experiment in download platform of Tencent, it is proved that
   the proposed mechanism increases the downloading rate, saves the traffic
   on the server and optimizes the system performance.

AB Location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Gowalla, Facebook,
   Foursquare, Brightkite, and so on, have attracted millions of users to
   share their social friendship and their locations via check-ins in the
   past few years. Plenty of valuable information is accumulated based on
   the check-in behaviors, which makes it possible to learn users' moving
   patterns as well as their preferences. In LBSNs, point-of-interest (POI)
   recommendation is one of the most significant tasks because it can help
   targeted users explore their surroundings as well as help third-party
   developers provide personalized services. Matrix factorization is a
   promising method for this task because it can capture users' preferences
   to locations and is widely adopted in traditional recommender systems
   such as movie recommendation. However, the sparsity of the check-in data
   makes it difficult to capture users' preferences accurately.
   Geographical influence can help alleviate this problem and have a large
   impact on the final recommendation result. By studying users' moving
   patterns, we find that users tend to check in around several centers and
   different users have different numbers of centers. Based on this, we
   propose a Multi-center Gaussian Model (MGM) to capture this pattern via
   modeling the probability of a user's check-in on a location. Moreover,
   users are usually more interested in the top 20 or even top 10
   recommended POIs, which makes personalized ranking important in this
   task. From previous work, directly optimizing for pairwise ranking like
   Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) achieves better performance in the
   top-k recommendation than directly using matrix matrix factorization
   that aims to minimize the point-wise rating error. To consider users'
   preferences, geographical influence and personalized ranking, we propose
   a unified POI recommendation framework, which unifies all of them
   together. Specifically, we first fuse MGM with matrix factorization
   methods and further with BPR using two different approaches. We conduct
   experiments on Gowalla and Foursquare datasets, which are two
   large-scale real-world LBSN datasets publicly available online. The
   results on both datasets show that our unified POI recommendation
   framework can produce better performance.

AB In view of the exponential growth of information generated by social
   networks, social network analysis and recommendation have become
   important for many web applications. This paper examines the problem of
   social collaborative filtering to recommend items of interest to users
   in a social network setting. Many social networks capture the
   relationships among the nodes by using trust scores to label the edges.
   The bias of a node denotes its propensity to trust/mistrust its
   neighbors and is closely related to truthfulness. It is based on the
   idea that the recommendation of a highly biased node should be removed.
   In this paper, we propose a model-based approach for recommendation
   employing matrix factorization after removing the bias nodes from each
   link, which naturally fuses the users' tastes and their trusted friends'
   favors together. The empirical analysis on real large datasets
   demonstrate that our approaches outperform other state-of-the-art
   methods.

AB Telecommunication (telco) operators aim to provide users with optimized
   services and bandwidth in a timely manner. The goal is to increase user
   experience while retaining profit. To do this, knowing the changing
   behavior patterns of users through their activity levels in advance can
   be a great help for operators to adjust theirmanagement strategies and
   reduce operational risk. To achieve this goal, the operators canmake use
   of knowledge discovered from telco's historical mobile broadband (MBB)
   records to predict mobile access activity level at an early stage. In
   this article, we report our research in a real-world telco setting
   involving more than one million telco users. Our novel contribution
   includes representing users as documents containing a collection of
   changing spatiotemporal "words" that express user behavior. By
   extracting users' space-time access records in MBB data, we use latent
   Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to learn user-specific compact topic features
   for user activity level prediction. We propose a scalable online
   expectation-maximization (OEM) algorithm that can scale LDA to massive
   MBB data, which is significantly faster than several state-of-the-art
   online LDA algorithms. Using these real-world MBB data, we confirm high
   performance in user activity level prediction. In addition, we show that
   the inferred topics indicate that future activity level anomalies
   correlate highly with early skewed bandwidth supply and demand
   relations. Thus, our prediction system can also guide the telco
   operators to balance the telecommunication network in terms of
   supply-demand relations, saving deployment costs and energy of cell
   towers in the future.

AB GPS trajectory dataset with high sampling-rates is usually in large
   volume that challenges the processing efficiency. Most of the data
   points on trajectories are useless. This paper summarizes trajectories
   using stop points. We define a new concept of stay stability (i.e., time
   dividing distance or reciprocal of speed) between any two GPS points to
   detect stop points on individual trajectories. We propose a novel Mining
   Repeat Travel Behaviors Using Stop Regions (MRTBUSR) method. In MRTBUSR,
   a stop region is a popular region containing a certain number of close
   stop points that can be grouped into a cluster. We then retrieve common
   sequences of stop regions to denote repeat route patterns and further
   analyze the stop durations on a stop region to find repeat travel
   behaviors. The experiments on 20 labeled trajectories selected from
   GeoLife demonstrated the semantic effect, accuracy and near linear
   efficiency of our proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB The increasing use of location-aware devices has led to an increasing
   availability of trajectory data. As a result, researchers devoted their
   efforts to developing analysis methods including different data mining
   methods for trajectories. However, the research in this direction has so
   far produced mostly isolated studies and we still lack an integrated
   view of problems in applications of trajectory mining that were solved,
   the methods used to solve them, and applications using the obtained
   solutions. In this paper, we first discuss generic methods of trajectory
   mining and the relationships between them. Then, we discuss and classify
   application problems that were solved using trajectory data and relate
   them to the generic mining methods that were used and real world
   applications based on them. We classify trajectory-mining application
   problems under major problem groups based on how they are related. This
   classification of problems can guide researchers in identifying new
   application problems. The relationships between the methods together
   with the association between the application problems and mining methods
   can help researchers in identifying gaps between methods and inspire
   them to develop new methods. This paper can also guide analysts in
   choosing a suitable method for a specific problem. The main contribution
   of this paper is to provide an integrated view relating applications of
   mining trajectory data and the methods used.

AB Location-based social networks (LBSNs) make it possible for servers to

   systems gained popularity in recent years. Recommender systems can
   automatically list candidate locations for users according to their
   preferences, which is different from traditional search methods.
   However, making effective recommendations suffers from data sparsity. In
   order to relieve this problem and achieve high effectiveness, we take
   context information into consideration and present a personalized
   location recommender system considering both user preference and local
   features in this paper. To be specific, we apply Labeled-LDA in user
   preference learning and local features inference processes, which are
   denoted as UL-LDA model and CL-LDA model, respectively. Because of this,
   we can make recommendations even on the condition that users are in a
   new city and have little information about the city. We evaluate our
   approach with extensive experiments on a large-scale Foursquare dataset.
   The experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of our

AB The maximum consensus problem is fundamentally important to robust
   geometric fitting in computer vision. Solving the problem exactly is
   computationally demanding, and the effort required increases rapidly
   with the problem size. Although randomized algorithms are much more
   efficient, the optimality of the solution is not guaranteed. Towards the
   goal of solving maximum consensus exactly, we present guaranteed outlier
   removal as a technique to reduce the runtime of exact algorithms.
   Specifically, before conducting global optimization, we attempt to
   remove data that are provably true outliers, i.e., those that do not
   exist in the maximum consensus set. We propose an algorithm based on
   mixed integer linear programming to perform the removal. The result of
   our algorithm is a smaller data instance that admits a much faster
   solution by subsequent exact algorithms, while yielding the same
   globally optimal result as the original problem. We demonstrate that
   overall speedups of up to 80% can be achieved on common vision

   Weighted Regression model is proposed to deal with the data
   heterogeneity nature pursuing more accurate predictions for the business
   turnouts. An experimental case study, using data about venues registered
   in Foursquare is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed

   Geographically Weighted Regression model experimental results showed
   better prediction accuracy compared to the classical Geographically
   Weighted Regression model.

AB With the wide availability of GPS devices in our lives, massive amounts
   of object movement data have been collected from various moving object
   targets, such as mobile devices, animals, and vehicles. In the last
   decade, Moving Object Databases (MOD) have attracted many researchers.
   Analyzing such data has deep implications in many areas, such as
   ecological study and traffic control. In this study, we focus on moving
   object data (moving points) analysis and retrieve valuable information
   for knowledge discovery. In this research, a moving object data model is
   implemented in the object-relational database system, additionally some
   special queries and data mining techniques are performed. Retrieving
   information directly from unorganized spatial-temporal data is almost
   impossible. However, not only a vast amount of spatial-temporal data
   sets organized into MOD data model but also the discovery of valuable
   knowledge from spatial-temporal data to help decision support processes
   is possible now owing to this research implementation.

AB Locating smartphone users will enable numerous potential applications
   such as monitoring customers in shopping malls. However, conventional
   received signal strength (RSS)-based room-level localization methods are
   not likely to distinguish neighboring zones accurately due to similar
   RSS fingerprints. We solve this problem by proposing a system called
   feature-based room-level localization (FRL). FRL is based on an
   observation that different rooms vary in internal structures and human
   activities which can be reflected by RSS fluctuation ranges and user
   dwell time respectively. These two features combing with RSS can be
   exploited to improve the localization accuracy. To enable localization
   of unmodified smartphones, FRL utilizes probe requests, which are
   periodically broadcast by smartphones to discover nearby access points
   (APs). Experiments indicate that FRL can reliably locate users in
   neighboring zones and achieve a 10% accuracy gain, compared with
   conventional methods like the histogram method.

AB Recommender systems have become indispensable tools for numerous
   industries and individual who utilize e-commerce. Although recommender
   systems rely on the similarities between the items to be recommended,
   most current research projects in this area utilize traditional
   algorithms for similarity measurement such as cosine distance or
   derivatives, etc. However, the most challenging problems occur due to
   the difficulties of quantification for those non-numeric values that are
   quite intractable and cannot be solved by using regular similarity
   measurement algorithms. This paper proposes a novel and effective method
   which utilizes a taxonomy tree to measure similarities between textual
   attributes based on their natural characteristics. Furthermore, a
   7-type-rule to cleanse the textual terms a is implemented for improving
   the recommender system. Finally, we evaluate our methods by implementing
   a recipe recommender system. The system achieves a 74.4 % overall
   satisfaction rate as evaluated by its users.

   algorithms, namely Random Forests and LambdaMART. We propose a feature
   set with 56 dimensions from the tourist's historical traveling data. By
   utilizing the entropy from information theory, all features are ranked.
   Evaluation results show that when selecting the most important subset of
   20 features as our final input of Random Forests, we can get a 4% higher
   accuracy and a 70% reduction of computation complexity with regard to
   using the full set of features. A comparison of five different machine
   learning algorithms, namely Random Forests, LambdaMART, Ranking SVM,
   ListNet and RankBoost, has been taken on this feature set, results
   demonstrate that the Random Forests outperforms the other algorithms.

AB The vast use of Location-Based Social Networks over the last decade
   results in a considerably large amount of data transactions accumulated
   over time. Data mining researchers exploit these large amounts of data
   produced by location-based social networks users to predict useful
   information. One of the highly recommended methods for prediction is
   learning from statistical observations through machine learning. In this
   paper, spatial machine learning techniques are suggested for predicting
   potential business investment openings in Location-Based Social
   Networks. Two spatial techniques are studied; Spatial Auto Regression
   model, and Inverse Distance Weight spatial interpolation technique. A
   modification for the Inverse Distance Weight spatial interpolation has
   been suggested where an extreme avoidance criterion is proposed, in
   order to enhance the prediction accuracy of the classical method. The
   modified interpolation method is compared to the spatial Auto Regression
   model and the classical Inverse Distance Weight spatial Interpolation
   technique, for considerations of computational complexity and prediction
   accuracy. An experimental case study involving data extracted from
   Foursquare has been tested for Business venue usage prediction. The
   results show better prediction accuracy for the Inverse Distance Weight
   spatial interpolation than the Spatial Moreover, better prediction
   accuracy for the proposed Extreme Avoidance spatial interpolation over
   both the Inverse Distance Weight spatial interpolation and Spatial Auto
   Regression is obtained while maintaining the low computational
   complexity of the spatial interpolation.

AB This paper presents an unsupervised approach to accurately discover
   interesting places in a city from locationbased social sensing
   applications, a new sensing application paradigm that collects
   observations of physical world from Location-based Social Networks
   (LBSN). While there are a large amount of prior works on personalized
   Point of Interests (POI) recommendation systems, they used supervised
   learning approaches that did not work for users who have little or no
   historic (training) data. In this paper, we focused on an interesting
   place discovery problem where the goal is to accurately discover the
   interesting places in a city that average people may have strong
   interests to visit (e.g., parks, museums, historic sites, etc.) using
   unsupervised approaches. In particular, we develop a new
   Physical-Social-aware Interesting Place Discovery (PSIPD) scheme which
   jointly exploits the location's physical dependency and the visitor's
   social dependency to solve the interesting place discovery problem using
   an unsupervised approach. We compare our solution with state-of-the-art
   baselines using two real world data traces from LBSN. The results showed
   that our approach achieved significant performance improvements compared
   to all baselines in terms of both estimation accuracy and ranking
   performance.

AB Recommending points of interests (POIs) is drawing more attention to
   meet the growing demand for tours. A POI's quality (sightseeing value)
   estimation is one of the important challenges. In contrast to
   conventional studies of ranking POIs based on user behavior analysis, in
   this paper, we propose methods of quality estimation by analyzing
   geosocial images. Our approach estimates the sightseeing value from two
   aspects: (1) nature value; and (2) culture value. For the nature value,
   we extract image features that are related to favorable human perception
   to verify whether a POI would meet tourists' psychological requirements.
   Three criteria, coherence, imageability and visual-scale, are defined
   accordingly. For the culture value, we recognize the cultural elements
   (i.e., architectures) included in a POI. In the experiments, by applying
   our methods on the real discovered POIs, we present the effect of our
   approach.

   to the popularity of the points of interest (POIs), inferred by
   considering, for instance, the number of check-ins on social networking
   services such as Foursquare, it also includes the user's profile, the
   current context of use, and the user's network of social ties. The
   system, therefore, consists of four main modules that accomplish the
   following tasks: (1) the construction of the user's profile according to
   her interests and tastes; (2) the creation of the path graph in the
   user's proximity; (3) the routing to locate the first k itineraries that
   match the query; (4) their ranking through a scoring function that
   considers the POI popularity, the user's profile, and her physical and
   social context. The proposed system was evaluated on a sample of 40 real
   users. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed
   recommender.

TI Context-aware Location Recommendations with Tensor Factorization

PY 2016
AB Location-based social networks (LBSNs) enable users not only to record
   where and when they go using check-ins but also to publish their ratings
   and comments of these locations. All information can be utilized to
   infer users' interests and to generate personalized location
   recommendations for different individuals. In this process, temporal
   context plays a significant role, because life patterns of users vary
   greatly and different locations have different proper visiting time.
   Therefore, in this paper, we propose a top-k location recommendation
   scheme, considering the influence of temporal context. To be specific,
   we first model user-location-time relations with a three dimensional
   tensor. Then, we extract a user-user similarity matrix and a location
   feature matrix to relieve data sparsity problem and to increase the
   prediction accuracy of estimated ratings during the tensor decomposition
   process. Through a context-aware tensor decomposition approach, we can
   obtain any user's rating for any location in any time slot. Moreover, we
   partition a large area into several small ones and adopt the Threshold
   Algorithm (TA) to improve efficiency of online recommendations. We
   evaluate our method in a real-world dataset and the results demonstrate
   the effectiveness of our method.

AB Service recommendation for Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) has
   been received much attention mainly in the field of large-scale Wireless
   Communication Networks. It is a promising solution to guarantee service
   reliability and improve quality of experience (QoE) of users. Many
   schemes have been proposed to provide the reliable and personalized
   services for users, such as collaborative filtering (CF), content-based
   recommendation(CBR), and context-aware recommendation, etc. However, the
   activity sequence and type popularity is lacked in above researches,
   which leads to the recommendation accuracy and service experience
   decline. In this paper, we propose TopSim-TP, a novel
   trajectory-pattern-based similar users discovery method aiming to
   effectively mine the life cycle and preference of users. First, we
   describe the mobile behavior of users by mapping location information
   into type information. Then, we model the trajectory-pattern for each
   user. Finally, we present a Common Trajectory-Pattern (CTP) extraction
   algorithm and compute the similarity of sequences to find the top-k
   similar users for current user. The experimental results show that our
   method outperforms the existing method.

   and mining trajectory data in the past decade, fostering a broad range
   of applications. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey on the
   major research into trajectory data mining, providing a panorama of the
   field as well as the scope of its research topics. Following a road map
   from the derivation of trajectory data, to trajectory data
   preprocessing, to trajectory data management, and to a variety of mining
   tasks (such as trajectory pattern mining, outlier detection, and
   trajectory classification), the survey explores the connections,
   correlations, and differences among these existing techniques. This
   survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into
   other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more
   data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied. Finally,
   some public trajectory datasets are presented. This survey can help
   shape the field of trajectory data mining, providing a quick

   geotagged photos (CCGPs) available on the Internet, which could be
   regarded as digital footprints of photo takers. In this paper, we

   based on topic distribution of his travel histories in other cities and
   the given context (i.e., season and weather). A topic model is used to
   mine the interest distribution of users, which is then exploited to
   build the user-user similarity model and make travel recommendations.
   The season and weather context information is considered during the
   mining and the recommendation processes. Our method is evaluated on a

AB We propose a novel approach to address the problem of the recognition of
   important locations. Our method is organised in two phases: first, a set
   of candidate stay points is identified by exploiting some
   state-of-the-art algorithms to filter the GPS-logs; then, the candidate
   stay points are mapped onto a feature space having as dimensions the
   area underlying the stay point, its intensity (the time spent in a
   location) and its frequency (the number of total visits). We conjecture
   that the features space allows to model aspects/measures that are more
   semantically related to users and better suited to reason about their
   similarities and differences than, e.g., latitude, longitude, and
   timestamp. An experimental evaluation on the GeoLife public dataset
   confirms the effectiveness of our approach.

   which is capable of generating a personalized list of preference
   attractions for the tourist. Modern technologies of classical
   recommender system, such as collaborative filtering are considered to be
   effectively adopted in the tourism domain. On the basis of collaborative
   filtering principle, the recommendation process of tourist attractions
   divided into three steps, representation of user (tourist) information,
   generation of neighbor users (tourists) and the generation of attraction
   recommendations. In order to calculate the similarities between each
   user, the Cosine method is adopted during the process of the generation
   of neighbors. And then the recommendations of attractions are generated
   according to the visiting history of the user's neighbors. In order to
   demonstrate the calculation process of the system, a case is
   demonstrated in detail.

AB Several previous mobility models aim at describing or predicting human
   behavior in a particular region during a certain period of time.
   Nevertheless, most of those models have been evaluated using data from a
   single source, such as data from mobile calls or GPS data obtained from
   Web applications. Thus, the effectiveness of such models when using
   different types of data remains unknown. This paper proposes a new model
   to predict human mobility, called MobDatU, which was designed to use
   data from mobile calls and data from georeferenced applications (in an
   isolated or combined way). MobDatU as well as two state-of-the-art
   models, namely SMOOTH and Leap Graph, are evaluated considering various
   scenarios with single data source and multiple data sources. The
   experiments indicate that MobDatU always produces results that are
   better than or at least comparable to the best baseline in all
   scenarios, unlike the previous models whose performance is very
   dependent on the particular type of data used.

AB Social sensing has emerged as a new application paradigm for smart
   cities where a crowd of social sources (humans or devices on their
   behalf) collectively contribute a large amount of observations about the
   physical world. This paper focuses on an interesting place finding
   problem in social sensing where the goal is to accurately identify the
   interesting places in a city where people may have strong interests to
   visit (e.g., parks, museums, historic sites, scenic trails, etc.).
   Solving this problem is not trivial because (i) many interesting places
   are not necessarily frequently visited by the average people and hence
   less likely to be found by the traditional recommendation systems; (ii)
   the user's social connections could directly affect their visiting
   behavior and the interestingness judgment of a given place. In this
   paper, we develop a new Social-aware Interesting Place Finding (SIPF)
   approach that solves the above problem by explicitly incorporating both
   the user's travel experience and social relationship into a rigorous
   analytical framework. The evaluation results showed that the new
   approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts using two
   real-world datasets collected from location-based social network
   service.

AB The growing use of Location Based Social Networks especially in recent
   years provides large amount of data transactions. These data
   transactions attract many data mining researchers to infer various
   information from them. In this paper, a geographic business prediction
   technique is proposed, which infers business usage by exploiting data
   published about venues in Location Based Social Networks. The proposed
   technique is beneficial for investors and business decision makers. The
   proposed geo-business prediction technique considers spatial and
   categorical factors in the prediction process. Both factors affect the
   prediction accuracy rather than using traditional spatial prediction
   techniques, which are usually used where only the location feature is
   involved in the prediction process. Additionally, an outlier filter is
   proposed and applied to the data to avoid extreme values involvement in
   the prediction process in order to achieve better prediction accuracy.
   To test the proposed technique, an experimental case study is
   implemented. It uses data extracted from Foursquare about business
   venues in Texas State in the United States of America. The proposed geo
   business prediction technique has shown to provide better prediction
   accuracy than k nearest neighbor spatial prediction. The Application of
   the outlier filter, results in even higher prediction accuracy for the
   proposed technique.

   in this paper. Unlike traditional content-based or collaborative
   filtering recommendation approaches, we collected large scale
   information from heterogeneous data sources to construct the public
   preference model for user's feature-based preference orientation
   classification. Moreover, the social relation graph of target user is
   constructed to analyze social influence of preference between users in
   it. Then, the social influence of preference is calculated by social
   influence and interest similarity between users. The purpose of this
   paper is that using public preference to infer user preference and
   further adjusting user preference through social influence of preference
   from neighbors. The proposed method deals with the cold-start issue in
   recommendation system. There two main advantages of the proposed method
   are social relationship can be easily obtained from online social
   network and any type of recommendation system can be applied in the
   proposed method. In our experiment, Facebook, the most famous social
   media, is the platform selected for social relationship analysis. The
   experimental result shows our approach not only innovation but also
   practicable.

AB Location-based services allow users to perform geospatial recording
   actions, which facilitates the mining of the moving activities of human
   beings. This article proposes to recommend time-sensitive trip routes
   consisting of a sequence of locations with associated timestamps based
   on knowledge extracted from large-scale timestamped location sequence
   data (e.g., check-ins and GPS traces). We argue that a good route should
   consider (a) the popularity of places, (b) the visiting order of places,
   (c) the proper visiting time of each place, and (d) the proper transit
   time from one place to another. By devising a statistical model, we
   integrate these four factors into a route goodness function that aims to
   measure the quality of a route. Equipped with the route goodness, we
   recommend time-sensitive routes for two scenarios. The first is about
   constructing the route based on the user-specified source location with
   the starting time. The second is about composing the route between the
   specified source location and the destination location given a starting
   time. To handle these queries, we propose a search method, Guidance
   Search, which consists of a novel heuristic satisfaction function that
   guides the search toward the destination location and a backward
   checking mechanism to boost the effectiveness of the constructed route.
   Experiments on the Gowalla check-in datasets demonstrate the
   effectiveness of our model on detecting real routes and performing cloze
   test of routes, comparing with other baseline methods. We also develop a
   system TripRouter as a real-time demo platform.

AB Providing better travel services for tourists is one of the important
   applications in urban computing. Though many recommender systems have
   been developed for enhancing the quality of travel service, most of them
   lack a systematic and open framework to dynamically incorporate multiple
   types of additional context information existing in the tourism domain,
   such as the travel area, season, and price of travel packages. To that
   end, in this article, we propose an open framework, the
   Objected-Oriented Recommender System (ORS), for the developers
   performing personalized travel package recommendations to tourists. This
   framework has the ability to import all the available additional context
   information to the travel package recommendation process in a
   cost-effective way. Specifically, the different types of additional
   information are extracted and uniformly represented as feature-value
   pairs. Then, we define the Object, which is the collection of the
   feature-value pairs. We propose two models that can be used in the ORS
   framework for extracting the implicit relationships among Objects. The
   Objected-Oriented Topic Model (OTM) can extract the topics conditioned
   on the intrinsic feature-value pairs of the Objects. The
   Objected-Oriented Bayesian Network (OBN) can effectively infer the
   cotravel probability of two tourists by calculating the co-occurrence
   time of feature-value pairs belonging to different kinds of Objects.
   Based on the relationships mined by OTM or OBN, the recommendation list
   is generated by the collaborative filtering method. Finally, we evaluate
   these two models and the ORS framework on real-world travel package
   data, and the experimental results show that the ORS framework is more
   flexible in terms of incorporating additional context information, and
   thus leads to better performances for travel package recommendations.
   Meanwhile, for feature selection in ORS, we define the feature
   information entropy, and the experimental results demonstrate that using
   features with lower entropies usually leads to better recommendation
   results.

   also engendered big issues, such as traffic congestion, energy
   consumption, and pollution. Urban computing aims to tackle these issues
   by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow,
   human mobility, and geographical data). Urban computing connects urban
   sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a
   recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of
   people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban
   computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet

   of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning,

   category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed

AB Many innovative location-based services have been established to offer
   users greater convenience in their everyday lives. These services
   usually cannot map user's physical locations into semantic names
   automatically. The semantic names of locations provide important context
   for mobile recommendations and advertisements. In this article, we
   proposed a novel location naming approach which can automatically
   provide semantic names for users given their locations and time. In
   particular, when a user opens a GPS device and submits a query with her
   physical location and time, she will be returned the most appropriate
   semantic name. In our approach, we drew an analogy between location
   naming and local search, and designed a local search framework to
   propose a spatiotemporal and user preference (STUP) model for location
   naming. STUP combined three components, user preference (UP), spatial
   preference (SP), and temporal preference (TP), by leveraging
   learning-to-rank techniques. We evaluated STUP on 466,190 check-ins of
   5,805 users from Shanghai and 135,052 check-ins of 1,361 users from
   Beijing. The results showed that SP was most effective among three
   components and that UP can provide personalized semantic names, and thus
   it was a necessity for location naming. Although TP was not as
   discriminative as the others, it can still be beneficial when integrated
   with SP and UP. Finally, according to the experimental results, STUP
   outperformed the proposed baselines and returned accurate semantic names
   for 23.6% and 26.6% of the testing queries from Beijing and Shanghai,
   respectively.

   ensure better privacy while forwarding queries/replies to/from untrusted

   model for location prediction to guide queries toward the LBS's location
   and to reduce required resources in terms of retransmission overheads.
   We develop a formal analytical model and present theoretical analysis
   and simulation of the proposed protocol performance. We further validate
   our results by performing extensive simulation experiments over a

   real-world data trace to compare LPAF to existing location privacy and
   benchmark protocols. We show that LPAF manages to keep higher privacy
   levels in terms of k-anonymity and quality of service in terms of
   success ratio and delay, as compared with other protocols, while
   maintaining lower overheads. Simulation results show that LPAF achieves
   up to an 11% improvement in success ratio for pseudorealistic scenarios,
   whereas real-world data trace experiments show up to a 24% improvement
   with a slight increase in the average delay.

AB The location-based social networks have been becoming flourishing in
   recent years. In this paper, we aim to estimate the similarity between
   users according to their physical location histories (represented by GPS
   trajectories). This similarity can be regarded as a potential social tie
   between users, thereby enabling friend and location recommendations.
   Different from previous work using social structures or directly
   matching users' physical locations, this approach model a user's GPS
   trajectories with a semantic location history (SLH), e.g., shopping
   malls -> restaurants -> cinemas. Then, we measure the similarity between
   different users' SLHs by using our maximal travel match (MTM) algorithm.
   The advantage of our approach lies in two aspects. First, SLH carries
   more semantic meanings of a user's interests beyond low-level geographic
   positions. Second, our approach can estimate the similarity between two
   users without overlaps in the geographic spaces, e.g., people living in
   different cities. When matching SLHs, we consider the sequential
   property, the granularity and the popularity of semantic locations. We
   evaluate our method based on a real-world GPS dataset collected by 109
   users in a period of 1 year. The results show that SLH outperforms a
   physicallocation-based approach and MTM is more effective than several
   widely used sequence matching approaches given this application
   scenario.

AB the rapid growth of cellphone users in cities enable the cellphone
   towers spread all over urban area in past years. The user call logs,
   which refer to users movement trajectory in urban area, can provide an
   opportunity to understand urban spatial structure. As the extraction of
   more popular channel of human movement in urban area, the hot lines
   highlighted the spatial morphology of human flows in urban structure. In
   this paper, we propose popularity index that utilizes diversity and
   density index of channel to identify the hot lines based on cellphone
   call detail record dataset. The density of cellphone users that travel
   across one channel and the diversity of travel behaviors from different
   cellphone users refer to one channel has been combined to infer the
   level of popularity index for each channel. In the case study, a call
   detail record dataset that generated from the users of an anonymous
   telecom in Wuhan has been applied to identify the hot lines. The results
   showed the effectiveness of our approach and can be used as references
   for more explicitly representing urban dynamics to support urban plan
   applications.

AB In recent years, Location-Based Services (LBSs) have been widely
   applied, and many websites provide LBSs which allow users to make trip
   planning with multiple activities on the Trip to meet their different
   demands (e.g., distance, location, service, etc.). However in most
   studies, trip planning just focuses on finding the shortest trip that
   goes through many services during visiting many locations (e.g.,
   resturant, gas station, and bank). In this paper, we take the trust of
   services provided at the POI into consideration among the trip,
   proposing an Efficient Trust-Oriented Trip Planning Method (ETOTP) in
   Road Networks, ETOTP for short. In a geographical trip planning, given a
   set points of interest (POIs) which may have many constraints (i.e., the
   category of the POI, and the trust of POI), the goal of this paper is to
   find an effective trip that (1) starts at a given location S, (2) ends
   at a given location D, (3) visits the POIs with the given categories,
   and (4) satisfies the trust requirements of the services. Since ETOTP
   covers the NP-Complete Multi-Constrained Path Selection (MCP) problem,
   it is NP-Complete as well. Therefore, it is a challenging problem to
   efficiently deliver a route with the required services and trust. Hence,
   in this work we propose three approximation algorithms for the ETOTP and
   conduct the experiments on a synthetic dataset in a real road network.
   The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can plan a
   trip having the shortest distance with higher trust values and good
   efficiency.

AB With the rapid growth of location-based services (LBS), web map service
   (WMS) is becoming indispensable in our daily life. From a new
   perspective, this paper measures and analyzes the user behaviors and
   regional differences in WMS, based on a big log dataset from the PC
   clients of a large-scale WMS provider. We give analysis on users'
   searching times from both macro and micro perspective, and point out
   that WMS data has a feature of searching behavior prediction, which is
   absent in other location-based datasets. Then, we observe and verify
   that the searching frequencies of point of interests in a city conform
   to Zipf distribution, and explain the underlying physical meanings of
   the corresponding parameters. In addition, we present a simple and
   intuitive approach to quantitatively study the inter-city fluidity and
   intra-city mobility patterns, and give semantic analysis on query
   categories in each city. And our work can serve as a measurement basis
   for future work in the area of WMS data mining.

AB The popularization of consumer electronic products and the promotion of
   digital mobile devices have assisted telematics services in becoming
   more important and practicable. The global positioning system(GPS) is
   commonly used today and context awareness technologies are often
   adopted. To support efficient and effective telecommunications between a
   huge number of devices and the intelligent transport systems (ITS)
   services, a scalable networking platform is hence demanded. In this
   study, we present a novel approach to support an open architecture
   environment for telematics services based on international standards.
   The proposed core telematics platform (CTP) can optimize the data
   transmission under linearly increased time complexity by employing a
   high-scalable architecture design when a large number of devices connect
   to the application servers. The proposed context awareness application
   server (CAAS) approach can optimize context awareness features to
   provide personal tracking services to children and elders for safety
   purposes. The simulations and experiments in this study have verified
   the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Personalized location-based service recommendation is an important trend
   in the development of online e-commerce applications. In this work, we
   integrate the application of location-based service with recommendation
   technologies to present a hybrid recommendation model and a prototype
   system (HiPerData) to evaluate and measure the validity based on the
   Yelp dataset. In order to solve the four recommendation problems, we
   improve a predictive feature-based regression model, and combine the
   results of a set of collaborative filtering algorithms, which includes:
   SVD (Singular value decomposition), SVR (Support vector regression), SGD
   (Stochastic gradient descent), etc. Unlike previous approaches, we apply
   multiple methods to pre- and post-process the dataset and predict
   ratings, for example, a weighted pairwise preference regression for cold
   start problems, etc. We enhance the neighborhood-based approach leading
   to a substantial improvement of prediction accuracy. Our method gave the
   best overall results with a root mean square error of 1.22724.

AB Credit card is a popular payment method and the transaction data keeps
   track of purchasing activities in people's daily lives. Extracting
   location of people's activities is an important task in many data mining
   problems because it may greatly help improve user experience and the
   service provided to people. Locating people from credit card
   transactions is equivalent to determining the location of every POS
   terminal where a payment takes place. This is however not an easy task
   because the locations of terminals are not usually provided to the
   credit card issuing companies and only a few terminals can be
   unambiguously located through map service by providing the merchants'
   names.
   In this paper, we propose a system to infer the locations of POS
   terminals using transaction data and map service. We first construct a
   transaction graph where the nodes are POS terminals. We then propose a
   two phase algorithm to find out uncertain and unknown locations of the
   terminals. In the first phase, we try to eliminate the uncertainty of
   POS terminals with multiple candidate locations. We show this problem is
   NP-hard and then give an effective heuristic algorithm to solve it. In
   the second phase, we compute the locations of unknown POS terminals by
   propagating the locations of known ones with spatial-temporal
   constraints. The algorithm is evaluated using a real-world credit card
   transaction data set and the result is promising for business
   applications.

AB Background: Type IV collagen is important for the structural integrity
   and function of basement membranes. Basement membranes surround vascular
   smooth muscle cells in the media, COL4A1 is the most abundant component
   of type IV collagen in all Basement membranes. However, the relationship
   between COL4A1 genetic polymorphisms and coronary artery disease (CAD)
   remains unclear. We performed a case-control study to explore the
   association of COL4A1 genetic polymorphisms with CAD in Uygur population
   of China. Methods: 1095 Uygur people (727 men, 368 women) including 471
   CAD patients and 624 controls were selected for the present study. Two
   SNPs (rs605143 and rs565470) were genotyped by using the polymerase
   chain reaction-restriction fragment length (PCR-RFLP) method.
   Results: For total and men, the rs605143 was found to be associated with
   CAD by in a dominate model (p = 0.014, p = 0.013, respectively). The
   difference remained statistically significant after multivariate
   adjustment (p = 0.036, p = 0.014, respectively). The rs565470 was also
   found to be associated with CAD in a recessive model for total and men
   (both p < 0.001), and the difference remained statistically significant
   after multivariate adjustment (P = 0.002, P = 0.001, respectively).
   Conclusion: Both rs605143 and rs565470 of COL4A1gene are associated with
   CAD in Uygur population of China.
