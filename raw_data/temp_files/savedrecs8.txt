AB We present the design, implementation, evaluation, and user experiences
   of the CenceMe application, which represents the first system that;
   combines the inference of the presence of individuals using
   off-the-shelf, sensor-enabled mobile phones with sharing of this
   information through social networking applications such as Facebook and
   MySpace. We discuss the system challenges for the development of
   software oil the Nokia N95 mobile phone. We present the design and
   tradeoffs of split-level classification, whereby personal sensing
   presence (e.g., walking, in conversation, at the gym) is derived front
   classifiers which execute in part oil the phones and in part oil the
   backend servers to achieve scalable inference. We report performance
   measurements that characterize the computational requirements of the
   software and the energy consumption of the CenceMe phone client. We
   validate the system through a user study where twenty two people,
   including undergraduates, graduates and faculty, used CenceMe
   continuously over a three week period in a campus town. From this user
   study we learn how the system performs in a production environment and
   what uses people find for a personal sensing system.

AB Spatial cognition researchers must, at present, choose between the
   relevance of the real world and the precision of the lab. Here I
   introduce cognitive surveying as a framework of computational techniques
   to enable the automated and precise study of spatial knowledge and
   navigation practices in everyday environments. I draw on surveying
   engineering to develop the framework's components: a hardware platform,
   data structures and algorithms for mobile data collection, and routines
   for data analysis and visualization. The cognitive surveying system
   tracks users with GPS, allows them to label meaningful points as
   landmarks, and asks them to point toward or estimate the distance to
   out-of-sight landmarks. The data from these and other questions is then
   used to produce specific analyses and comprehensive overviews of the
   user's spatial knowledge and navigation practices, which will be of
   great interest to spatial cognition researchers, the developers of
   location-based services, urban designers, and city planners alike.

AB Mobile intention recognition is the problem of inferring a mobile
   agent's intentions from her spatio-temporal behavior. The intentions an
   agent can have in a specific situation depend on the spatial context,
   and on the spatially contextualized behavior history. We introduce two
   spatially constrained grammars that allow for modeling of complex
   constraints between space and intentions, one based on Context-Free, one
   based on Tree-Adjoining Grammars. We show which of these formalisms is
   suited best for frequently occurring intentional patterns. We argue that
   our grammars are cognitively comprehensible, while at the same time
   helping to prune the search space for intention recognition.

AB Safety and security are top concerns in maritime navigation,
   particularly as maritime traffic continues to grow and as crew sizes are
   reduced. The Automatic Identification System (AIS) plays a key role in
   regard to these concerns. This system, whose objective is in part to
   identify and locate vessels, transmits location-related information from
   vessels to ground stations that are part of a so-called Vessel Traffic
   Service (VTS), thus enabling these to track the movements of the
   vessels. This paper presents techniques that improve the existing AIS by
   offering better and guaranteed tracking accuracies at lower
   communication costs. The techniques employ movement predictions that are
   shared between vessels and the VTS. Empirical studies with a prototype
   implementation and real vessel data demonstrate that the techniques are
   capable of significantly improving the AIS.

AB The discovery of a person's meaningful places involves obtaining the
   physical locations and their labels for a person's places that matter to
   his daily life and routines. This problem is driven by the requirements
   from emerging location-aware applications, which allow a user to pose
   queries and obtain information in reference to places, for example,
   "home", "work" or "Northwest Health Club". It is a challenge to map from
   physical locations to personally meaningful places due to a lack of
   understanding of what constitutes the real users' personally meaningful
   places. Previous work has explored algorithms to discover personal
   places from location data. However, we know of no systematic empirical
   evaluations of these algorithms, leaving designers of location-aware
   applications in the dark about their choices.
   Our work remedies this situation. We extended a clustering algorithm to
   discover places. We also defined a set of essential evaluation metrics
   and an interactive evaluation framework. We then conducted a large-scale
   experiment that collected real users' location data and personally
   meaningful places, and illustrated the utility of our evaluation
   framework. Our results establish a baseline that future work can measure
   itself against. They also demonstrate that that our algorithm discovers
   places with reasonable accuracy and outperforms the well-known K-Means
   clustering algorithm for place discovery. Finally, we provide evidence
   that shapes more complex than "points" are required to represent the
   full range of people's everyday places.

AB With the continuing advances in wireless communications,
   geo-positioning, and portable electronics, an infrastructure is emerging
   that enables the delivery of on-line, location-enabled services to very
   large numbers of mobile users. A typical usage situation for mobile
   services is one characterized by a small screen and no keyboard, and by
   the service being only a secondary focus of the user. Under such
   circumstances, it is particularly important to deliver the "right"
   information and service at the right time, with as little user
   interaction as possible. This may be achieved by making services context
   aware. Mobile users frequently follow the same route to a destination as
   they did during previous trips to the destination, and the route and
   destination constitute important aspects of the context for a range of
   services. This paper presents key concepts underlying a software
   component that identifies and accumulates the routes of a user along
   with their usage patterns and that makes the routes available to
   services. The problems associated with of route recording are analyzed,
   and algorithms that solve the problems are presented. Experiences from
   using the component on logs of GPS positions acquired from vehicles
   traveling within a real road network are reported.

AB Location is the most essential presence information for mobile users. In
   this paper, we present an improved time-based clustering technique for
   extracting significant locations from CPS data stream. This new location
   extraction mechanism is incorporated with Google Maps for realizing
   cooperative place annotation on mobile instant messengers (MIM). To
   enhance the context-awareness of the MIM system, we further develop an
   ontology-based presence model for inferring the location clues of IM
   buddies. The GPS-based location extraction algorithm has been
   implemented on a Smartphone and evaluated using a real-life GPS trace.
   We show that the proposed clustering algorithm can achieve more accurate
   results as it considers the time interval of intermittent location
   revisits. The incorporation of location information with the high-level
   contexts, such as mobile user's current activity and their social
   relationship, can achieve more responsive and accurate presence update.

AB The user profile is one of the main context-information in a wide range
   of pervasive computing applications. Modem handheld devices provided
   with localization capabilities could automatically create a diary of
   user's whereabouts and use that information as a surrogate (or a
   complement) of the user profile. The places we go, in fact, reveal also
   something about us, for example, two persons can be matched as
   compatible given the fact they visit the same places. Web-retrieved
   information, and the temporal patterns with which different places are
   visited, can be used to automatically define meaningful semantic labels
   to the visited places. In our work we used geocoding and white-pages
   Web-services to extract information about a place, and Bayesian networks
   to classify places on the basis of the time in which they have been
   visited. In this paper we describe the general idea at the basis of the
   whereabouts diary, discuss our implementation, and present experimental
   results. Finally, several applications that can exploit the diary are
   illustrated.

AB Accurate location of people in indoor environments is a key aspect of
   many applications such as resource management, or security. In this
   paper, we explore the use of short-range radio technologies to track
   people indoors. The network consists of two kind of radio nodes: static
   nodes (anchors) and mobile nodes (people). From a set of sparse
   connectivity matrices (people vs. people and people vs. anchors) at each
   time instant; and people's dynamics, we infer people's trajectories. To
   combine connectivity and dynamic information, we propose an extension of
   Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Dynamic Weighted MDS (DWMDS), that finds
   an embedding of people's trajectories (x and y coordinates of people
   through time). DWMDS has proven to be more accurate and effective,
   especially for low connectivity degree networks (i.e. sparse networks),
   compared to existing location algorithms. Extensive simulations show the
   effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Personal experience computing is an emerging research area in computing
   support for capturing, archiving, and editing. This paper presents our
   design, implementation, and evaluation of a mobile authoring tool called
   mProducer that enables everyday users to effectively and efficiently
   perform archiving and editing at or immediately after the
   point-of-capture of digital personal experiences from their
   camera-equipped mobile devices. This point-of-capture capability is
   crucial to enable immediate sharing of digital personal experiences
   anytime, anywhere. For example, we have seen everyday people who used
   handheld camcorders to capture and report their personal, eye-witnessed
   experiences during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack in New York
   (The September I I Digital Archive. http://www.911digitalarchive.org/).
   With mProducer, they would be able to perform editing immediately after
   the point of capture, and then share these newsworthy, time-sensitive
   digital experiences on the Internet. To address the challenges in both
   user interface constraints and limited system resources on a mobile
   device, mProducer provides the following innovative system techniques
   and UI designs. (1) Keyframe-based editing UI enables everyday users to
   easily and efficiently edit recorded digital experiences from a mobile
   device using only key frames with the storyboard metaphor. (2) Storage
   constrained uploading (SCU) algorithm archives continuous multimedia
   data by uploading them to remote storage servers at the point of
   capture, so that it alleviates the problem of limited storage on a
   mobile device. (3) Sensor-assisted automated editing uses data from a
   GPS receiver and a tilt sensor attached to a mobile device to facilitate
   two manual editing steps at the point of capture: removal of blurry
   frames from hand-induced camera shaking, and content search via
   location-based content management. We have conducted user studies to
   evaluate mProducer. Results from the user studies have shown that
   mProducer scores high in user satisfaction in editing experience,
   editing quality, task performance time, ease of use, and ease of
   learning.

   injects sensing presence into popular social networking applications

   cell phones and offers a number of services, which can be activated on a
   per-buddy basis to expose different degrees of a user's sensing
   presence; these services include, life patterns, my presence, friend

   flow. Only a single inexpensive camera worn on the body is required,
   which may be reused for other purposes such as HCI. Result show that
   distance estimates are accurate (6-12%) while rotation tends to be
   underestimated. The accumulation of errors is compensated by identifying
   previously visited locations and "closing the loop"; it results in
   greatly enhanced accuracy. Opportunistic use of wireless signatures is
   used to identify similar locations. No a-priori knowledge of the

AB The emergence of cell phones with embedded Global Positioning System
   (GPS) chips provides opportunities to push personalized real-time travel
   information subject to an individual's current location. One such
   application, a travel assistant device, notifies cognitively disabled
   public transportation users when it is time to request a stop and exit
   the vehicle. GPS-enabled cell phones must provide highly accurate
   real-time location data for this type of service. The components used in
   the data-collection process are identified, and a quantitative analysis
   of real-time GPS data obtained with a cell phone while walking, driving
   a vehicle, and riding public transportation is provided. The expectation
   was that position accuracy would suffer when the GPS signal was
   obstructed by a vehicle or the user's clothing. The obtained data
   demonstrate the results of location fix attempts over different
   transportation modes in an urban environment. The highest percentage of
   GPS fixes (79.0%) was obtained by users walking with the cell phone open
   and, unobstructed; walking also produced valid GPS data (i.e., location
   data estimated to be accurate within 30 m of the true position) 66.2% of
   the time. For bus trips, GPS and valid fix percentages were 71.7% and
   66.1%, respectively, when the phone was held near the window; when the
   phone was placed in the traveler's lap, these numbers fell to 51.3% and
   27.8%, respectively. Car trips provided higher numbers: 77.7% and 71.6%,
   respectively. Location-based transportation applications are feasible
   using current technology, but predictive algorithms may be required to
   deliver highly accurate and timely location-aware services to cell phone
   users in highly obstructed environments.

AB We describe a method called Predestination that uses a history of a
   driver's destinations, along with data about driving behaviors, to
   predict where a driver is going as a trip progresses. Driving behaviors
   include types of destinations, driving efficiency, and trip times.
   Beyond considering previously visited destinations, Predestination
   leverages an open-world modeling methodology that considers the
   likelihood of users visiting previously unobserved locations based on
   trends in the data and on the background properties of locations. This
   allows our algorithm to smoothly transition between "out of the box"
   with no training data to more fully trained with increasing numbers of
   observations. Multiple components of the analysis are fused via Bayesian
   inference to produce a probabilistic map of destinations. Our algorithm
   was trained and tested on hold-out data drawn from a database of GPS
   driving data gathered from 169 different subjects who drove 7,335
   different trips.

AB Unmanned vehicle driving systems are getting interesting for the auto
   mobile industry. One of the key issues in the unmanned vehicle driving
   system is how to acquire the current position of the vehicle. In
   general, it can be achieved by Global Positioning System (GPS). However
   if the unmanned vehicle will be parked in the parking garage by itself
   GPS can not provide sufficient information to avoid collisions and the
   accuracy of GPS is not enough for the narrow parking space. An automatic
   vehicle parking system is proposed in the paper where wireless sensor
   networks and infrared technologies are adopted simultaneously to enhance
   the accuracy of positioning. The prototype of the proposed automatic
   vehicle parking system is also implemented.

   Markov and state predictor we use additionally an optimization, the
   confidence counter. The criterions for the comparison are the prediction
   accuracy, the quantity of useful predictions, the stability, the
   learning, the relearning, the memory and computing costs, the modelling
   costs, the expandability, and the ability to predict the time of
   entering the next location. For evaluation we use the same benchmarks
   containing movement sequences of real persons within an office building.

   the same place where the user went at different time. The learned
   significant locations are important basis of further service, such as
   predicting the user's future movement, building the user's own map etc.
   At last, we introduce a prototype system based on the learning method to

   location system in a metropolitan environment. We explore five factors
   effecting positioning accuracy: location algorithm choice, scan set
   size, simultaneous use of cells from different providers, training and
   testing on different devices, and calibration data density. We collected
   a 208-hour, 4350 Km driving trace of three different GSM networks
   covering the Seattle metropolitan area. We show a median error of 94m in
   downtown and 196m in residential areas using a single GSM network and
   the best algorithm for each area. Estimating location using multiple
   providers' cells reduces median error to 65-134 meters and 95% error to
   163m in the downtown area, which meets the accuracy requirements for
   E911. We also show that a small 60-hour calibration drive is sufficient
   for enabling a metropolitan area similar to Seattle.

AB Neural networks, Bayesian networks, Markov models, and state predictors
   are different methods to predict the next location. For all methods a
   lot of parameters must be set up which differ for each user. Therefore a
   complex configuration must be made before such a method can be used. A
   hybrid predictor can reduce the configuration overhead utilizing
   different prediction methods or configurations in parallel to yield
   different prediction results. A selector chooses the most appropriate
   prediction result from the result set of the base predictors. We propose
   and evaluate three principal hybrid predictor approaches the warm-up
   predictor, the majority predictor, and the confidence predictor - with
   several variants. The hybrid predictors reached a higher prediction
   accuracy than the average of the prediction accuracies of the separately
   used predictors.

AB In ubiquitous computing we need to know the present in order to interact
   properly with nearby smart elements. When we are moving outdoors, mobile
   devices take a very important role because they provide us with a link
   between the world outside and ourselves through means of intelligent
   interfaces. There are a lot of situations in which it would be very
   useful to know or foresee the future context, i.e. as a geographic
   environment, where we could find ourselves in a near future, and at the
   same time being able to use that information from our devices. Therefore
   we must preview this location with enough precision and time and be able
   to use this information from our mobile device. In our "OnTheWay"
   system, we used GPS technology and databases made of past paths taken by
   a person, in order to predict the next location, once we had begun a new
   course, comparing the new one with those ones stored. The results were
   amazing: from the data collected about paths travelled during a month
   and five days, we got the actual destination in 98% of cases, when we
   have only made a 30,35% of the total path. Therefore, including
   statistic and semantic information will allow us to upgrade our results,
   due to the sedentary human behaviour, the small number of frequently
   visited locations and the fact that the paths used to arrive to these
   locations are usually the same.

AB The availability of mobile computing and satellite technologies make it
   possible to develop applications that are aware of user location.
   However, as the amount of collected data grows quickly, coming up with
   techniques that ease interpretation of such data is essential. In this
   paper, we employ a data mining approach to infer regularly visited
   locations and the routes between them from GPS (Global Positioning
   System) logs captured in an incremental fashion by a PDA. In our
   implementation, outdoor locations can be detected as well indoor
   locations visited by the users. Once the list of locations is
   determined, this list is clustered to group locations in close
   proximity. After clustering and reduction, the original database is
   scanned for transitions between location groups to find the routes. If
   there are similar routes between origin and destination then these will
   be merged, and finally a list of different routes between two locations
   will be obtained. This; technique could be used as part of a monitoring
   system for vehicles that are aware of their location and security as
   well as using logs from different users to create a dynamic map of the
   regions where digital maps are not available or not feasible.

AB Location-awareness and prediction of future locations is an important
   problem in pervasive and mobile computing. In cellular systems (e.g.,
   GSM) the serving cell is easily available as an indication of the user
   location, without any additional hardware or network services. With this
   location data and other context variables we can determine places that
   are important to the user, such as work and home. We devise online
   algorithms that learn routes between important locations and predict the
   next location when the user is moving. We incrementally build clusters
   of cell sequences to represent physical routes. Predictions are based on
   destination probabilities derived from these clusters. Other context
   variables such as the current time can be integrated into the model. We
   evaluate the model with real location data, and show that it achieves
   good prediction accuracy with relatively little memory, making the
   algorithms suitable for online use in mobile environments.

AB Location contexts are important for many context-aware applications. A
   significant location is a specialized form of location context for
   expressing a user's daily activity. We propose a method to cluster
   positions measured by cellular phones into significant locations with
   multiple radii. Cellular phones we used are equipped with a positioning
   system, where data can be taken in low frequency with wide-varying
   estimated errors. In order to learn significant locations, our system
   exploits multiple radii for coping with these characteristics and for
   adapting to a variety of users' spatial behavioral patterns. We also
   discuss appropriate parameters for our clustering method.

AB This paper investigates the efficiency of in-door next location
   prediction by comparing several prediction methods. The scenario
   concerns people in an office building visiting offices in a regular
   fashion over some period of time. We model the scenario by a dynamic
   Bayesian network and evaluate accuracy of next room prediction and of
   duration of stay, training and retraining performance, as well as memory
   and performance requirements of a Bayesian network predictor. The
   results are compared with further context predictor approaches - a state
   predictor and a multi-layer perceptron predictor using exactly the same
   evaluation set-up and benchmarks. The publicly available Augsburg Indoor
   Location Tracking Benchmarks are applied as predictor loads. Our results
   show that the Bayesian network predictor reaches a next location
   prediction accuracy of up to 90% and a duration prediction accuracy of
   up to 87% with variations depending on the person and specific predictor
   set-up. The Bayesian network predictor performs in the same accuracy
   range as the neural network and the state predictor.

AB In this paper, we introduce a compact system for fusing location data
   with data from simple, low-cost, non-location sensors to infer a user's
   place and situational context. Specifically, the system senses location
   with a GSM cell phone and a WiFi-enabled mobile device (each running
   Place Lab), and collects additional sensor data using a 2" x 1" sensor
   board that contains a set of common sensors (e.g. accelerometers,
   barometric pressure sensors) and is attached to the mobile device. Our
   chief contribution is a multi-sensor system design that provides
   indoor-outdoor location information, and which models the capabilities
   and form factor of future cell phones. With two basic examples, we
   demonstrate that even using fairly primitive sensor processing and
   fusion algorithms we can leverage the synergy between our location and
   non-location sensors to unlock new possibilities for mobile context
   inference. We conclude by discussing directions for future work.

AB As the ubiquitous computing vision materializes, the number and
   diversity of digital elements in our environment increases. Computing
   capability comes in various forms and is embedded in different physical
   objects, ranging from miniature devices such as human implants and tiny
   sensor particles, to large constructions such as vehicles and entire
   buildings. The number of possible interactions among such elements, some
   of which may be invisible or offer similar functionality, is growing
   fast so that it becomes increasingly hard to combine or select between
   them. Mechanisms are thus required for intelligent matchmaking that will
   achieve controlled system behavior yet without requiring the user to
   continuously input desirable options in an explicit manner In this paper
   we argue that information about the co-location relationship of
   computing elements is quite valuable in this respect and can be
   exploited to guide automated service selection with minimal or no user
   involvement. We also discuss the implementation of such mechanism that
   is part of our runtime system for smart objects.

AB Personal paths capture "personal meaningful places" [13, 14] in temporal
   sequence. Knowledge of a user's paths enables novel and useful features
   for location-aware applications, e.g., traffic condition updates for
   commuting routes, carpool partner finding with similar commuting routes
   and schedules. Prior work has explored algorithms to discover
   "significant locations" [1,2] and "transportation routes" [6,9] from GPS
   data, however, we know of no algorithms specifically designed for sparse
   GPS traces, which represent typical location datasets collected from GPS
   enabled mobile devices. In this paper, we report two spatio-temporal
   clustering algorithms, TDJ and R-TDJ, for discovering personal paths.
   Specifically, the algorithms are designed to address the noisy and
   sparse nature of GPS data. Our experiment results show that both TDJ and
   R-TDJ discovered meaningful spatio-temporal clusters to form personal
   paths. R-TDJ demonstrates better performance on sparse GPS data.

AB Location-enhanced mobile devices are becoming common, but applications
   built for these devices find themselves suffering a mismatch between the
   latitude and longitude that location sensors provide and the colloquial
   place label that applications need. Conveying my location to my spouse,
   for example as (48.13641N, 11.57471E), is less informative than saying
   "at home." We introduce an algorithm called Beacon-Print that uses WiFi
   and GSM radio fingerprints collected by someone's personal mobile device
   to automatically learn the places they go and then detect when they
   return to those places. BeaconPrint does not automatically assign names
   or semantics to places. Rather, it provides the technological foundation
   to support this task. We compare BeaconPrint to three existing
   algorithms using month-long trace logs from each of three people.
   Algorithmic results are supplemented with a survey study about the
   places people go. BeaconPrint is over 90% accurate in learning and
   recognizing places. Additionally, it improves accuracy in recognizing
   places visited infrequently or for short durations-a category where
   previous approaches have fared poorly. BeaconPrint demonstrates 63%
   accuracy for places someone returns to only once or visits for less than
   10 minutes, increasing to 80% accuracy for places visited twice.

AB In this paper, we propose a way to retrieve and invoke ubiquitous
   objects within our living spaces by our behavior. Accumulations of GPS
   location information collected by a. tiny program on a user's cellular
   phone are organized into a structure which represents the user's spatial
   behavior. This representation provides ubiquitous computing environment
   with assumptions about the user's movement in one-day duration, and
   allow them to act for the predicted future locations of the user. Since
   this knowledge representation about the user's daily route is a key to
   invoke ubiquitous objects by her/his current spatial behavior, we call
   it "Behavior-based Personal Controller" or "BPC".A learning algorithm to
   organize the Behavior-based Personal Controller and a mechanism of the
   BPC's invoking networked ubiquitous objects are detailed in this paper.

AB Location estimation is an important part of many ubiquitous computing
   systems. Particle filters are simulation-based probabilistic
   approximations which the robotics community has shown to be effective
   for tracking robots' positions. This paper presents a case study of
   applying particle filters to location estimation for ubiquitous
   computing. Using trace logs from a deployed multi-sensor location
   system, we show that particle filters can be as accurate as common
   deterministic algorithms. We also present performance results showing it
   is practical to run particle filters on devices ranging from high-end
   servers to handhelds. Finally, we discuss the general advantages of
   using probabilistic methods in location systems for ubiquitous
   computing, including the ability to fuse data from different sensor
   types and to provide probability distributions to higher-level services
   and applications. Based on this case study, we conclude that particle
   filters are a good choice to implement location estimation for
   ubiquitous computing.

AB Pervasive resp. ubiquitous systems use context information to adapt
   appliance behavior to human needs. Even more convenience is reached if
   the appliance foresees the user's desires. By means of context
   prediction systems get ready for future human activities and can act
   proactively.
   Predictions, however, are never 100% correct. In case of unreliable
   prediction results it is sometimes better to make no prediction instead
   of a wrong prediction. In this paper we propose three confidence
   estimation methods and apply them to our State Predictor Method. The
   confidence of a prediction is computed dynamically and predictions may
   only be done if the confidence exceeds a given barrier. Our evaluations
   are based on the Augsburg Indoor Location Tracking Benchmarks and show
   that the prediction accuracy with confidence estimation may rise by the
   factor 1.95 over the prediction method without confidence estimation.
   With confidence estimation a prediction accuracy is reached up to 90%.

AB People often misplace objects they care about. We present a system that
   generates reminders about objects left behind by tagging those objects
   with passive RFID tags. Readers positioned in the environment frequented
   by users read tags and broadcast the tags' IDs over a short-range
   wireless medium. A user's personal server collects the read events in
   real-time and processes them to determine if a reminder is warranted or
   not. The reminders are delivered to a wristwatch-sized device through a
   combination of text messages and audible beeps. We believe this leads to
   a practical and scalable approach in terms of system architecture and
   user experience as well as being more amenable to maintaining user
   privacy than previous approaches. We present results that demonstrate
   that current RFID tag technology is appropriate for this application
   when integrated with calendar information.
