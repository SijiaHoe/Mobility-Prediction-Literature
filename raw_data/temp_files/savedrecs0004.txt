AB Bike-sharing is a new low-carbon and environment-friendly mode of public
   transport based on the sharing economy. Since 2017, the bike-sharing
   market has boomed in China's major cities. Bikes equipped with GPS
   transmitters are docked along sidewalks that can be easily accessed
   through smartphone apps. However, this new form of transport has also
   led to problems, such as illegal parking, vandalism, and theft, each of
   which presents a major administrative challenge. Further, imbalances in
   user demand and bike availability need to be overcome to ensure a
   convenient, flexible service for customers. Hence, predicting a
   cyclist's destination could be of great importance to shared-bike
   operators. In this paper, we propose an innovative deep learning model
   to predict the most probable destination for each user. The model,
   called destination prediction network based on spatiotemporal data
   (DPNst), comprises three steps. First, the data is preprocessed and a
   pool of likely candidate destinations is generated based on frequent
   item mining. This candidate set is then used to build the DPNst model: a
   long short-term memory network learns the user's behavior; a
   convolutional neural network learns the spatial relationships between
   the origin and the candidate destinations; and a fully connected neural
   network learns the external features. In the final step, DPNst
   dynamically aggregates the output of the three neural networks based on
   the given data and generates the predictions. In a series of experiments
   on real-world stationless bike-sharing data, DPNst returned an F1 score
   of 42.71% and demonstrated better performance overall than the compared
   baselines.

AB The use of web services for analysing and visualising maps has received
   great attention recently, because the complicated analysis of spatial
   data requires different processes to be run consecutively. Predicting
   the future location of a vehicle on a street network is one of the most
   challenging analyses used for improving context-aware location-based
   services, intelligent transportation systems and criminology. In this
   research, the authors present a new short-term prediction algorithm and
   explore the required analyses and web services. They present an
   appropriate method for chaining these web services to predict
   location(s). To assess their methodology, they developed a prototype
   system and tested for trajectories in Beijing. This system calculates
   the prediction time for a specified car to show the predicted future
   location in the street network. Their results showed that the average
   transferred data volume increases as the prediction period increases.
   The results also showed that the prediction algorithm has 75% accuracy
   at 1 min and 87.5% accuracy at 2 and 3 min. The implemented chaining
   method reduces the complexity of the location prediction algorithm for
   users because they do not need to know the processes. The outputs from
   this system can be used as input parameters for other web-based
   applications.

AB With the accumulation of the vast amount of location data acquired by
   positioning devices embedded in mobile phones and cars, position
   prediction of moving objects has been an important research direction
   for many location-based services such as public transit forecasting and
   tourist behavior analysis. In this paper, a position prediction system
   has been proposed, which utilizes not only spatial but also temporal
   regularity of object mobility. Historical trajectory data of the object
   is used to extract personal trajectory patterns to obtain candidate next
   positions. Each of the candidate next positions is scored by the
   proposed Spatio-Temporal Regularity-based Prediction (STRP) algorithm
   according to time components of patterns and current time. The position
   with the highest score is considered as the predicted next position.
   Furthermore, a hybrid B/S and C/S architecture is employed to perform
   the real-time prediction and results display. An evaluation based on two
   different public trajectory data sets demonstrates that the proposed
   STRP algorithm achieves highly accurate position prediction. Moreover,
   the average accuracy rate of our prediction algorithm with one known
   position is about 86.8%, which is 43.9% better than the Markov-based
   algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Personal mobility data can nowadays be easily collected by personal
   mobile phones and used for analytical modeling. To assist in such an
   analysis, a variety of computational approaches have been developed. The
   goal is to extract mobility patterns in order to provide traveling
   assistance, information, recommendations or on-demand services. While
   various computational techniques are being developed, research
   literature on destination and route prediction lacks consistency in
   evaluation methods for such approaches. This study presents a review and
   categorization of evaluation criteria and terminology used in assessing
   the performance of such methods. The review is complemented by
   experimental analysis of selected evaluation criteria, to highlight the
   nuances existing between the evaluation measures. The experimental study
   uses previously unpublished mobility data of 15 users collected over a
   period of 6 months in Helsinki metropolitan area in Finland. The article
   is primarily intended for researchers developing approaches for
   personalized mobility analysis, as well as a guideline for practitioners
   to select criteria when assessing and selecting between computational
   approaches. Our main recommendation is to consider user-specific
   accuracy measures in addition to averaged aggregates, as well as to take
   into consideration that for many users accuracy does not saturate fast
   and the performance keeps evolving over time. Therefore, we recommend
   using time-weighted measures. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Automatic discovery of significant locations from row GPS data is the
   first phase of mining mobility pattern and developing location-aware
   services. Unfortunately, current location discovery algorithms are
   ineffective when locations have different local properties such as
   density. Moreover, these algorithms suffer from the sharp boundary
   problem that is assigning some close points to different locations while
   they intuitively belong to one location. This article presents a novel
   framework, GraphLoc that formulates location discovery as a network
   community detection problem to address these issues. Experimental
   results show that GraphLoc's locations lead to higher performance in
   mobility mining and location prediction.

AB Precise destination prediction of taxi trajectories can benefit many
   intelligent location based services such as accurate ad for passengers.
   Traditional prediction approaches, which treat trajectories as
   one-dimensional sequences and process them in single scale, fail to
   capture the diverse two-dimensional patterns of trajectories in
   different spatial scales. In this paper, we propose T-CONV which models
   trajectories as two-dimensional images, and adopts multi-layer
   convolutional neural networks to combine multi-scale trajectory patterns
   to achieve precise prediction. Furthermore, we conduct gradient analysis
   to visualize the multi-scale spatial patterns captured by T-CONV and
   extract the areas with distinct influence on the ultimate prediction.
   Finally, we integrate multiple local enhancement convolutional fields to
   explore these important areas deeply for better prediction.
   Comprehensive experiments based on real trajectory data show that T-CONV
   can achieve higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Moving destination prediction offers an important category of
   location-based applications and provides essential intelligence to
   business and governments. In existing studies, a common approach to
   destination prediction is to match the given query trajectory with
   massive recorded trajectories by similarity calculation. Unfortunately,
   due to privacy concerns, budget constraints, and many other factors, in
   most circumstances, we can only obtain a sparse trajectory dataset. In
   sparse dataset, the available moving trajectories are far from enough to
   cover all possible query trajectories; thus the predictability of the
   matching-based approach will decrease remarkably. Toward destination
   prediction with sparse dataset, instead of searching similar
   trajectories over the sparse records, we alternatively examine the
   changes of distances from sampling locations to final destination on
   query trajectory. The underlying idea is intuitive: It is directly
   motivated by travel purpose, people always get closer to the final
   destination during the movement. By borrowing the conception of gradient
   descent in optimization theory, we propose a novel moving destination
   prediction approach, namely MGDPre. Building upon the mobility gradient
   descent, MGDPre only investigates the behavior characteristics of query
   trajectory itself without matching historical trajectories, and thus is
   applicable for sparse dataset. We evaluate our approach based on
   extensive experiments, using GPS trajectories generated by a sample of
   taxis over a 10-day period in Shenzhen city, China. The results
   demonstrate that the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our
   approach outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods.

   strategies: the individual strategy uses only the user individual

   individual systematic behaviors, and the hybrid strategy that is a

AB Moving route prediction offers important benefits for many emerging
   location-aware applications such as target advertising and urban traffic
   management. A common approach to route prediction is to match similar
   trace recordings from a larger volume of historical trajectories, and
   return the targeted recorded path as desired answer. However, due to
   privacy concerns, incentive mechanism and other reasons, especially in
   small business environment, a limited dataset with sparse trajectories
   is only available. Actually, the existing sparse dataset cannot cover
   sufficient query routes, and then the match-based approach may return no
   results at all. Moreover, the existing sparse dataset may fail many
   trajectory mining approaches that work well on general environment. In
   this paper, we investigate moving route prediction from sparse
   trajectory dataset, and propose a novel hybrid model, namely HMRP, to
   address the above problem. To avoid sparse distribution over spatial
   semantic layer, a road network map reconstruction methods are proposed
   to accommodate the sparse trajectories in semantic transformation. And
   then, by training historical trajectories, the implicit mobility
   patterns and Markov transition model are constructed to support route
   prediction. When a query trajectory arrives, towards its derived
   potential destination, our proposed HMRP model integrates pattern
   matching strategy and Markov probability distribution to predict its
   future route gradually in a complementary way. Experiments on real-life
   taxicab GPS recorded dataset demonstrate that HMRP method can improve
   movement prediction precision significantly, comparing with the baseline
   prediction algorithms. And the response time for each query trajectory
   is acceptable for most application cases.

AB Frequent route pattern mining from personal trajectory data is the basis
   of location awareness and location services. However, because personal
   trajectory data is highly uncertain, most existing approaches are only
   capable of finding short and incomplete route patterns. In this paper, a
   novel approach is proposed for the discovery of frequent route patterns
   based on trajectory abstraction. First, trajectory partition, location
   extraction, data simplification, and common segment discovery are used
   to abstract trajectory data, convert these trajectories into common
   segment temporal sequences (STS) and generate 1-frequent itemsets. Then,
   a pattern mining algorithm is proposed based on the spatial-temporal
   adjacency relationship. This algorithm uses the constraint mechanism and
   bidirectional projected database to mine frequent route patterns from
   STS. Based on the real GeoLife trajectory data, the experimental results
   indicate that the proposed method has better performance and can find
   longer route patterns than other currently available methods.

AB Traffic surveillance has become an important topic in intelligent
   transportation systems (ITSs), which is aimed at monitoring and managing
   traffic flow. With the progress in computer vision, video-based
   surveillance systems have made great advances on traffic surveillance in
   ITSs. However, the performance of most existing surveillance systems is
   susceptible to challenging complex traffic scenes (e.g., object
   occlusion, pose variation, and cluttered background). Moreover, existing
   related research is mainly on a single video sensor node, which is
   incapable of addressing the surveillance of traffic road networks.
   Accordingly, we present a review of the literature on the video-based
   vehicle surveillance systems in ITSs. We analyze the existing challenges
   in video-based surveillance systems for the vehicle and present a
   general architecture for video surveillance systems, i.e., the
   hierarchical and networked vehicle surveillance, to survey the different
   existing and potential techniques. Then, different methods are reviewed
   and discussed with respect to each module. Applications and future
   developments are discussed to provide future needs of ITS services.

   and analysis of the properties of generated context trees, we
   demonstrate the foundation for understanding and modelling behaviour
   afforded. Summarising user contexts into a single data structure gives
   easy access to information that would otherwise remain latent, providing
   the basis for better understanding and predicting the actions and
   behaviours of individuals and groups. Finally, we also present a method
   for pruning context trees for use in applications where it is desirable
   to reduce the size of the tree while retaining useful information.

AB The proliferation of GPS enabled devices has led people to share
   locations both consciously and unconsciously. Large spatio-temporal data
   comprising of shared locations and whereabouts are now being routinely
   collected for analysis. As user movements are generally driven by their
   interests, so mining these mobility patterns can reveal commonalities
   between a pair of users. In this paper, we present a framework for
   mining the published trajectories to identify patterns in user mobility.
   In this framework, we extract the locations where a user stays for a
   period of time popularly known as stay points. These stay points help to
   identify the interests of a user. The statistics of pattern and check-in
   distributions over the GPS data are used to formulate similarity
   measures for finding K-nearest neighbors of an active user. In this
   work, we categorize the neighbors into three groups namely strongly
   similar, closely similar and weakly similar. We introduce three
   similarity measures to determine them, one for each of the categories.
   We perform experiments on a real-world GPS log data to find the
   similarity scores between a pair of users and subsequently find the
   effective K-neighbors. Experimental results show that our proposed
   metric outperforms existing metrics in literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier

AB High-accuracy location identification is the basis of location awareness
   and location services. However, because of the influence of GPS signal
   loss, data drift and repeated access in the individual trajectory data,
   the efficiency and accuracy of existing algorithms have some
   deficiencies. Therefore, we propose a two-step clustering approach to
   extract individuals' locations according to their GPS trajectory data.
   Firstly, we defined three different types of stop points; secondly, we
   extracted these points from the trajectory data by using the
   spatio-temporal clustering algorithm based on time and distance. The
   experimental results show that the spatio-temporal clustering algorithm
   outperformed traditional extraction algorithms. It can avoid the
   problems caused by repeated access and can substantially reduce the
   effects of GPS signal loss and data drift. Finally, an improved
   clustering algorithm based on a fast search and identification of
   density peaks was applied to discover the trajectory locations. Compared
   to the existing algorithms, our method shows better performance and
   accuracy.

AB Destination prediction is very important in location-based services such
   as recommendation of targeted advertising location. Most current
   approaches always predict destination according to existing trip based
   on history trajectories. However, no existing work has considered the
   difference between the effects of passing-by locations and the
   destination in history trajectories, which seriously impacts the
   accuracy of predicted results as the destination can indicate the
   purpose of traveling. Meanwhile, the temporal information of history
   trajectories in destination prediction plays an important role. On one
   hand, the history trajectories in different periods also differ in the
   influence, e.g., the history trajectories from last week can reflect the
   status quo more accurately than the history trajectories two years ago.
   On the other hand, the history trajectories in different time slots
   reflect different facts of traffic and moving habits of people, e.g.,
   visiting a restaurant in the daytime and visiting a bar at night.
   Although a huge amount of history trajectories can be achieved in the
   era of big data, it is still far from covering all the query
   trajectories since a road network is widely distributed and trajectory
   data is sparse. The temporal sensitivity of history trajectories
   highlights the sparsity problem even more. Therefore, we propose a novel
   model T-DesP to solve the aforementioned problems. The model is
   comprised of two modules: trajectory learning and destination
   prediction. In the module of trajectory learning, a novel method called
   the mirror absorbing Markov chain model is proposed for modeling the
   trajectories for isolating the destination. We build a transition tensor
   to deduce the transition probability between each location pair in a
   particular time slot. To address the data sparsity problem, we fill the
   missing values in transition tensor through a context-aware tensor
   decomposition approach. In the module of destination prediction, an
   absorbing tensor is derived from the filled transition tensor, and the
   theoretical model is established for destination prediction. The
   experiments prove the effectiveness and efficiency of T-DesP.

   would suggest 8 research areas. Only 4 of them are actually covered by
   the collected pieces of work. They are discussed in turn showing off the

   areas highlights new research areas with a special focus on the
   possibility to use mobile data to influence individual users towards

AB Frequent route is an important individual outdoor behavior pattern that
   many trajectory-based applications rely on. In this paper, we propose a
   novel framework for extracting frequent routes from personal GPS
   trajectories. The key idea of our design is to accurately detect road
   corners and utilize these new metaphors to tackle the problem of
   frequent route extraction. Concretely, our framework contains three
   phases: 1) characteristic point (CP) extraction; 2) corner detection;
   and 3) trajectory mapping. In the first phase, we present a linear
   fitting-based algorithm to extract CPs. In the second phase, we develop
   a multiple density level DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of
   applications with noise) algorithm to locate road corners by clustering
   CPs. In the third phase, we convert each trajectory into an ordered
   sequence of road corners and obtain all routes that have been traversed
   by an individual for at least F (frequency threshold) times. We evaluate
   the framework using real-world trajectory datasets of individuals for
   one year and the experimental results demonstrate that our framework
   outperforms the baseline approach by 7.8% on average in terms of
   precision and 21.9% in terms of recall.

AB A personally semantic place is a space that is frequently visited by an
   individual user and carries important semantic meanings (e.g. home,
   work, etc.) to the user. Many location-aware applications could be
   greatly enhanced by the ability of automatic discovery of personally
   semantic places. The discovery of a user's personally semantic places
   involves obtaining the physical locations and semantic meanings of these
   places. In this paper, we propose approaches to address both of the
   problems. For the physical place extraction problem, a hierarchical
   clustering algorithm is proposed to firstly extract visit points from
   the GPS trajectories, and then clusters these visit points to form
   physical places. For the semantic place recognition problem, the
   temporal, spatial and sequential features in which the places have been
   visited are explored to categorize them into pre-defined types. An
   extensive set of experiments conducted based on a dataset of real-world
   GPS trajectories has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed

   proposed a process based decomposition of video surveillance systems to
   obtain functions approximating each ones time consumption. The
   integration of these components guided us to generic mathematical models
   validated through experimentations. The comparison between them shows a
   considerably lower response time for a distributed architecture over a

AB With the wide use of mobile devices, predicting the destination of
   moving vehicles has become an increasingly important problem for
   location based recommendation systems and destination-based advertising.
   Most existing approaches are based on various Markov chain models, in
   which the historical trajectories are used to train the model and the
   top-k most probable destinations are returned. We identify certain
   limitations of the previous approaches. Instead, we propose a new
   data-driven framework, called DESTPRE, which is not based on a
   probabilistic model, but directly operates on the trajectories and makes
   the prediction. We make use of only historic trajectories, without
   individual identity information. Our design of DESTPRE, although simple,
   is a result of several useful observations from the real trajectory
   data. DESTPRE involves an index based on Bucket PR Quadtree and Minwise
   hashing, for efficiently retrieving similar trajectories, and a
   clustering on destinations for predictions. By incorporating some
   additional ideas, we show that the prediction accuracy can be further
   improved. We have conducted extensive experiments on real Beijing Taxi
   dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
   DESTPRE.

AB Traffic surveillance has become an important topic in intelligent
   transportation systems (ITSs), which is aimed at monitoring and managing
   traffic flow. With the progress in computer vision, video-based
   surveillance systems have made great advances on traffic surveillance in
   ITSs. However, the performance of most existing surveillance systems is
   susceptible to challenging complex traffic scenes (e.g., object
   occlusion, pose variation, and cluttered background). Moreover, existing
   related research is mainly on a single video sensor node, which is
   incapable of addressing the surveillance of traffic road networks.
   Accordingly, we present a review of the literature on the video-based
   vehicle surveillance systems in ITSs. We analyze the existing challenges
   in video-based surveillance systems for the vehicle and present a
   general architecture for video surveillance systems, i.e., the
   hierarchical and networked vehicle surveillance, to survey the different
   existing and potential techniques. Then, different methods are reviewed
   and discussed with respect to each module. Applications and future
   developments are discussed to provide future needs of ITS services.

AB Destination prediction is an essential task for many emerging
   location-based applications such as recommending sightseeing places and
   targeted advertising according to destinations. A common approach to
   destination prediction is to derive the probability of a location being
   the destination based on historical trajectories. However, almost all
   the existing techniques use various kinds of extra information such as
   road network, proprietary travel planner, statistics requested from
   government, and personal driving habits. Such extra information, in most
   circumstances, is unavailable or very costly to obtain. Thereby we
   approach the task of destination prediction by using only historical
   trajectory dataset. However, this approach encounters the "data sparsity
   problem", i.e., the available historical trajectories are far from
   enough to cover all possible query trajectories, which considerably
   limits the number of query trajectories that can obtain predicted
   destinations. We propose a novel method named Sub-Trajectory Synthesis
   (SubSyn) to address the data sparsity problem. SubSyn first decomposes
   historical trajectories into sub-trajectories comprising two adjacent
   locations, and then connects the sub-trajectories into "synthesised"
   trajectories. This process effectively expands the historical trajectory
   dataset to contain much more trajectories. Experiments based on real
   datasets show that SubSyn can predict destinations for up to ten times
   more query trajectories than a baseline prediction algorithm.
   Furthermore, the running time of the SubSyn-training algorithm is almost
   negligible for a large set of 1.9 million trajectories, and the
   SubSyn-prediction algorithm runs over two orders of magnitude faster
   than the baseline prediction algorithm constantly.

AB This paper proposes a system architecture and case study for a
   heterogeneous moving-object trajectory metamodel using generic sensors.
   In order to provide a unified metamodel and powerful framework for
   trajectory's services and queries, the proposed trajectory's data model
   has benefited from advantages of both conceptual and ontological
   space-time. However, it extends the basic data model of trajectory with
   new patterns as the space-time path to describe activities of the moving
   object and the composite region of interest. Additionally, the proposed
   system is distinguished by providing a framework for dealing with
   moving-object trajectory in an interoperable way, using heterogonous
   sensors that traditional data model incapable for this purpose. The
   proposed system architecture for the moving-object trajectory's data
   model is focused on service composability and data interoperability
   combining Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, Service-Oriented
   Architecture, and streaming technology, to allow applications built
   using the framework to be scalable and have better performance. The case
   study presented for tracking travelers at the airport means that
   passenger locations can be determined with a higher degree of accuracy
   and precision. Indeed, this system makes it easy to answer complex
   queries, such as seeing closely where passengers congregate, how much
   time they spend in stores and restaurants, and where there may be
   bottlenecks. It will also enable airport retailers to communicate with
   travelers directly.

AB Personalized route prediction is an important technology in many
   applications related to intelligent vehicles and transportation systems.
   Current route prediction technologies used in many general navigation
   systems are, by and large, based on either the shortest or the fastest
   route selection. Personal traveling route prediction is a very
   challenging big data problem, as trips getting longer and variations in
   routes growing. It is particularly challenging for real-time in-vehicle
   applications, since many embedded processors have limited memory and
   computational power. In this paper we present a machine learning
   algorithm for modeling route prediction based on a Markov chain model,
   and a route prediction algorithm based on a probability transition
   matrix. We also present two data reduction algorithms, one is developed
   to map large GPS based trips to a compact link-based standard route
   representation, and another a machine learning algorithm to
   significantly reduce the size of a probability transition matrix. The
   proposed algorithms are evaluated on real-world driving trip data
   collected in four months, where the data collected in the first three
   months are used as training and the data in the fourth month are used as
   testing. Our experiment results show that the proposed personal route
   prediction system generated more than 91% prediction accuracy in average
   among the test trips. The data reduction algorithm gave about 8:1
   reduction in link-based standard route representation and 23: 1 in
   reducing the size of probability transition matrix.

AB Traditionally, travel demand modelling focused on long-term multiple
   socio-economic scenarios and land-use configurations to estimate the
   required transport supply. However, the limited number of transportation
   requests in demand-responsive flexible transport systems require a
   higher resolution zoning. This work analyses users short-term
   destination choice patterns, with a careful analysis of the available
   data coming from various different sources, such as GPS traces and
   social networks. We use a Multinomial Logit Model, with a social
   component for utility and characteristics, both derived from Social
   Network Analyses. The results from the model show meaningful
   relationships between distance and attractiveness for all the different
   alternatives, with the variable distance being the most significant.

AB We put forward architecture of a framework for integration of data from
   moving objects related to urban transportation network. Most of this
   research refers to the GPS outdoor geolocation technology and uses
   distributed cloud infrastructure with big data NoSQL database. A network
   of intelligent mobile sensors, distributed on urban network, produces
   congestion traffic patterns. Congestion predictions are based on
   extended simulation model. This model provides traffic indicators
   calculations, which fuse with the GPS data for allowing estimation of
   traffic states across the whole network. The discovery process of
   congestion patterns uses semantic trajectories metamodel given in our
   previous works. The challenge of the proposed solution is to store
   patterns of traffic, which aims to ensure the surveillance and
   intelligent real-time control network to reduce congestion and avoid its
   consequences. The fusion of real-time data from GPS-enabled smartphones
   integrated with those provided by existing traffic systems improves
   traffic congestion knowledge, as well as generating new information for
   a soft operational control and providing intelligent added value for
   transportation systems deployment.

   satellites to compute its current location on Earth and records the

   information is downloaded and recorded each time the fishing vessel
   docks for fueling. Currently, over 10 thousand devices are installed and
   tracked, collecting over 3 billion GPS samples over 8 years period. This
   paper presents our approach to clean and reorganize the data, and design
   an efficient incremental updatable database for fast query on the state
   of vessels and the spacial locations of vessels. We have also adapted
   the WebGL technology for visualization of trajectories with more than

AB With the help of various positioning tools, individuals' mobility
   behaviors are being continuously captured from mobile phones, wireless
   networking devices and GPS appliances. These mobility data serve as an
   important foundation for understanding individuals' mobility behaviors.
   For instance, recent studies show that, despite the dissimilarity in the
   mobility areas covered by individuals, there is high regularity in the
   human mobility behaviors, suggesting that most individuals follow a
   simple and reproducible pattern. This survey paper reviews relevant
   results on uncovering mobility patterns from GPS datasets. Specially, it
   covers the results about inferring locations of significance for
   prediction of future moves, detecting modes of transport, mining
   trajectory patterns and recognizing locationbased activities. The survey
   provides a general perspective for studies on the issues of individuals'
   mobility by reviewing the methods and algorithms in detail and comparing
   the existing results on the same issues. Several new and emergent issues
   concerning individuals' mobility are proposed for further research. (C)

AB Nowadays, navigation applications in smartphones are widely used in our
   daily lives. But the problem existing in using the applications is that
   a lot of operations between users and smartphones are needed, such as
   destination setting, options setting and zooming in/out. Potential
   dangers may bring to the users when they are walking on the street or
   especially driving. In this paper, we study providing an automatical
   navigation system, in which the number of users' operations is largely
   reduced. The navigation system can automatically predict user's future
   possible destinations and routes without any operation from users. The
   prediction is performed by analyzing both user's current position and
   historical tracing data. We implement the proposed system on the Android
   platform. The experimental results show that the application works
   effectively to provide anticipated routes and destinations for a single
   user.

AB Predicting movements of mobile users has become increasingly popular
   because of the ease of trajectory data collecting nowadays. However, as
   most of these prediction techniques need geographic pattern matching of
   users' trajectory data, it is possible that the techniques cannot work
   in a place where the user has never been before. In this paper, we
   propose an approach based on transportation mode and behavior semantic
   features to predict the next location of the users' movement. First, we
   identify the users' transportation mode to get sequential data of the
   users' motion mode. Then, we get the semantic meaning as behavior
   semantic features from the places where users have stopped and visited
   for a while. We determine the relationship between the transportation
   mode and behavior semantic features to predict the next location based
   on the Hidden Markov model. We use real world data for our experiment to
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB With increasingly prevalent mobile positioning devices, such as GPS
   loggers, smart phones, and GPS navigation devices, a huge amount of
   trajectories data is collected. Users are able to obtain the various
   location-based services by uploading their trajectories. In this paper,
   we address that a user's movement behavior is able to discover by their
   similar shape trajectories and resulted in some regions frequently stay
   in common, called relevant stay regions. Once a set of stay regions
   discovered, we can predict the next region where the user intends to go
   and provide location-based information of the next stay in advance, such
   as traffic status, targeted advertises, sightseeing recommendations, and
   so on. Prior works have elaborated on discovering stay region from the
   whole crowd trajectories and then exploring the relations between the
   regions to describe the movement patterns for location prediction.
   However, the trajectories pass the same region may not have the similar
   movement behavior. Thus, we propose a framework to discover stay regions
   relevant to the specific movement behavior and then applied in location
   prediction, called Region Modeling and Mobility Prediction. The proposed
   framework includes two modules: region modeling and mobility prediction.
   In the region modeling module, we develop shape clustering method to
   group the similar trajectories from historical data and then explore the
   stay region model from trajectory clusters. Based on the discovered
   region model, the mobility prediction module provide a cluster selection
   algorithm and several prediction strategies to generate the top-k
   relevant stay regions. Experiments results on real datasets demonstrate
   the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed model on detecting next
   stay region, comparing with other baseline methods.

AB In this paper we present an approach to predict a target of a mobile
   user on the move. After observing the movement from a starting point, we
   are able to create possible extrapolations of routes. Our basic
   assumption: a mobile user tries to move efficiently, thus only a certain
   set of destinations is reasonable. We use a road network that contains
   information about movement costs to detect reasonable movements, but we
   do not expect theoretical optimal paths. We are able to model different
   efficiency goals and different degrees of optimality. We present an
   efficient algorithm to actually compute the set of reasonable targets
   that avoids brute force computation. In contrast to existing work to
   predict route destinations, we do not require a learning phase to
   collect an archive of former routes.

AB As there is great differences of movement patterns and social
   correlation between weekdays and weekends, we propose a fallback
   social-temporal-hierarchic Markov model (FSTHM) to predict individual's
   future location. The division of weekdays and weekends is used to
   decompose the original state of traditional Markov model into two
   different states and distinguish the difference of the strength of
   social ties on weekdays and weekends. Except for the time division, the
   distribution of the visit time for each state is also considered to
   improve the predictive performance. In addition, in order to best suit
   the characteristics of Markov model, we introduce the modified
   cross-sample entropy to quantify the similarities between the individual
   and his friends. The experiments based on real location-based social
   network show the FSTHM model gives a 9% improvement over the Markov
   model and 2% improvement over the social Markov models which use cosine

AB Mobile user similarity is significant for location-based social network
   services. With the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies,
   research on measuring mobile user similarity based on their trajectories
   has attracted a lot of attention. However, trajectories imply only
   short-term mobile regularities, and thus users' long-term activity
   similarity is difficult to be captured. In this paper, we address the
   problem of mining users' long-term activity similarity based on their
   trajectories. To solve this problem, we propose a two-stage approach. At
   the first stage, the notion of routine activity is proposed to capture
   users' long-term activity regularities. The routine activities of a user
   are extracted from his/her daily trajectories. At the second stage, user
   similarity is calculated hierarchically based on the extracted routine
   activities. Finally, we evaluated our approach based on both real and
   artificial datasets. The experimental results show that users with
   different profiles can be discriminated on the basis of our similarity
   metric, and thus demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2013

AB A route trajectory is described as the upcoming course of the road in
   geographical terms as well as in terms of time. This enables the
   possibility of providing context-aware applications in modern vehicles.
   In order to generate such a trajectory with its context aware
   information, it is still necessary to enter a destination point into a
   navigation system. However, the most frequent commutations (drives,
   trips) are to known destinations and are therefore not performed with
   any active guidance system. This means that the prediction must be
   determined in a different manner. This paper presents a method, which
   predicts the route trajectory of a vehicle based on the travel history
   of its user. In addition to the traveled distance further context
   parameters are used for the prediction. These parameters include the
   current time of day, day of week and the route frequency, which
   indicates the number of times a particular route has already been
   traveled. Moreover, the developed prediction is evaluated in a
   volunteers study with about 500 rides and about 9.500 driven kilometers.
   The results show that in 80 percent of the cases the forward-lying path
   can be predicted correctly.

AB Destination prediction is an essential task for many emerging location
   based applications such as recommending sightseeing places and targeted
   advertising based on destination. A common approach to destination
   prediction is to derive the probability of a location being the
   destination based on historical trajectories. However, existing
   techniques using this approach suffer from the "data sparsity problem",
   i.e., the available historical trajectories is far from being able to
   coverall possible trajectories. This problem considerably limits the
   number of query trajectories that can obtain predicted destinations. We
   propose a novel method named Sub-Trajectory Synthesis(SubSyn) algorithm
   to address the data sparsity problem. SubSyn algorithm first decomposes
   historical trajectories into sub-trajectories comprising two
   neighbouring locations,and then connects the sub-trajectories into
   "synthesised" trajectories. The number of query trajectories that can
   have predicted destinations is exponentially increased by this means.
   Experiments based on real datasets show that SubSyn algorithm can
   predict destinations for upto ten times more query trajectories than a
   baseline algorithm while the SubSyn prediction algorithm runs over two
   orders of magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm. In this paper,we
   also consider the privacy protection issue in case an adversary uses
   SubSyn algorithm to derive sensitive location information of users. We
   propose an efficient algorithm to select a minimum number of locations a
   user has to hide on her trajectory in order to avoid privacy leak.
   Experiments also validate the high efficiency of the privacy protection
   algorithm.

   presents the design and implementation of Your Way Your Missions (YWYM),
   which is a location-aware pervasive game exploiting the routes of
   players. YWYM provides a Google Mapsbased tool for players to predefine
   routes, and utilizes self-reporting method to obtain the planned routes
   of players. By such a design, missions are returned to players in terms
   of the location properties of missions and the planned routes of
   players. A field study was conducted to investigate the usage of YWYM,
   and the results indicate that route predefining and self-reporting
   methods are an effective approach to obtain the planned routes of
   players, and information adaptation based on the planned routes of
   players could help them find missions at any place and any time.

   and estimating the next location with low resource needs, which makes it
   possible to execute them on mobile devices. The original algorithms have
   been divided into two phases, thus being possible to mix them and check
   which combination is the best one to obtain better prediction accuracy
   or lower resource consumption. To make such comparisons, a set of
   GSM-based mobility traces of 95 different users is considered. Finally,
   a prototype for mobile devices that integrates the predictors in a

   an example of how to take advantage of location prediction in an
