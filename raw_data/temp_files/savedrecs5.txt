AB Pervasive computing and social computing are two major computing
   paradigms of this decade, which have evolved more or less in isolation
   from each other. Integrating pervasive systems with social media can
   enhance the users' experience and enable them to form pervasive
   communities with others that share similar interests, habits, profile,
   behaviour, to communicate and interact with them, to socialise and to
   share their resources in a seamless manner. But to be able to couple the
   advantages of pervasive computing and social networking, the wealth of
   user context information available needs to be properly processed,
   managed and exploited. This imposes several critical requirements
   regarding reliable context learning and reasoning facilities. This paper
   presents a multi-user context inference mechanism that is based on
   Neural Networks and aims to exploit the knowledge available at community
   level. This mechanism has been evaluated via various experiments and is
   proven to perform quite well, even in cases of community members, about
   whom only limited volumes of historical context data are available.

AB Several methods have been proposed to analyse trajectory data. However,
   a few of these methods consider trajectory relations with relevant
   features of the geographic space. One of the best-known methods that
   take into account the geographical regions crossed by a trajectory is
   the SMoT algorithm. Nevertheless, SMoT considers only disjoint
   geographic regions that a trajectory may traverse, while many regions of
   interest are contained in other regions. In this article, we extend the
   SMoT algorithm for discovering stops in nested regions. The proposed
   algorithm, called SMoT+, takes advantage of information about the
   hierarchy of nested regions to efficiently discover the stops in regions
   at different levels of this hierarchy. Experiments with real data show
   that SMoT+ detects stops in nested regions, which are not detected by
   the original SMoT algorithm, with minor growth of processing time.

AB We study anomaly detection in a context that considers user trajectories
   as input and tries to identify anomalies for users following normal
   routes such as taking public transportation from the workplace to home
   or vice versa. Trajectories are modeled as a discrete-time series of
   axis-parallel constraints ("boxes") in the 2-D space. The anomaly can be
   estimated by considering two trajectories, where one trajectory is the
   current movement pattern and the other is a weighted trajectory
   collected from N norms. The proposed system was implemented and
   evaluated with eight individuals with cognitive impairments. The
   experimental results showed that recall was 95.0% and precision was
   90.9% on average without false alarm suppression. False alarms and false
   negatives dropped when axis rotation was applied. The precision with
   axis rotation was 97.6% and the recall was 98.8%. The average time used
   for sending locations, running anomaly detection, and issuing warnings
   was in the range of 15.1-22.7 s. Our findings suggest that the ability
   to adapt anomaly detection devices for appropriate timing of self-alerts
   will be particularly important.

AB Over the last few years, GPS guidance systems have become increasingly
   more popular. GPS-equipped devices like smart phones become more common
   and larger amounts of GPS data become available to geographic
   applications. Having precise information about the routes of a driver
   during a period of time can be useful to learn and estimate both the
   traffic and the driver's intent at specific moment of time. With our
   solution we want to go a step further to the existing GPS navigation
   systems by designing a mechanism that is capable to learn driver's
   routes. We could offer in the future a point-to-point concept for an
   environmentally friendly routing mechanism anywhere within a selected
   road network based on our HMM-method and a training process. Our study
   is based on real data collected from various local drivers and can be
   easily applied in modern intelligent traffic systems. The system comes
   with a user interface that displays the GPS routes on the map for a
   specific driver. These routes can be analyzed using parameters like
   time, distance, height and speed. Also we developed a tool that manages
   to compute the maximum-likelihood using the Viterbi algorithm in order
   to validate the next route segment election for a sampled road network.

   TECHNOLOGIES (ICCCNT
PD 2014
PY 2014
AB The purpose of received signal strength (RSS) correction in radio-map
   based Wi-Fi localization is to obtain a set of fine-grain
   location-dependent RSS fingerprints, and eventually achieve the purpose
   of highly accurate and reliable localization. To meet this goal, the RSS
   correction is conducted on the raw RSS samples to eliminate the
   environmental noise from the radio-map. This paper shows the
   comprehensive analysis on the autocorrelation property of the
   chronological RSS samples in the same RSS sequence, and meanwhile
   presents the correlated RSS correction approach. Furthermore, the
   correlated RSS correction approach can also be integrated into the
   conventional radio-map based K nearest neighbor (KNN) and weighted KNN
   (WKNN) localization algorithms. The experimental results conducted on
   the real Wi-Fi RSS samples recorded in a representative indoor
   environment prove that the proposed correlated RSS correction approach
   can result in the significant improvement of accuracy over the
   conventional radio-map based localization.

   considerably matured, so has the number of challenges in designing,
   implementing, and evaluating activity recognition systems. This tutorial
   aims to provide a comprehensive hands-on introduction for newcomers to
   the field of human activity recognition. It specifically focuses on
   activity recognition using on-body inertial sensors. We first discuss
   the key research challenges that human activity recognition shares with
   general pattern recognition and identify those challenges that are
   specific to human activity recognition. We then describe the concept of
   an Activity Recognition Chain (ARC) as a general-purpose framework for
   designing and evaluating activity recognition systems. We detail each
   component of the framework, provide references to related research, and
   introduce the best practice methods developed by the activity
   recognition research community. We conclude with the educational example
   problem of recognizing different hand gestures from inertial sensors
   attached to the upper and lower arm. We illustrate how each component of
   this framework can be implemented for this specific activity recognition
   problem and demonstrate how different implementations compare and how
   they impact overall recognition performance.

AB Location prediction enables us to use a person's mobility history to
   realize various applications such as efficient temperature control,
   opportunistic meeting support, and automated receptionists. Indoor
   location prediction is a challenging problem, particularly due to a high
   density of possible locations and short transition distances between
   these locations. In this paper we present Indoor-ALPS, an Adaptive
   Indoor Location Prediction System that uses temporal-spatial features to
   create individual daily models for the prediction of when a user will
   leave their current location (transition time) and the next location she
   will transition to. We tested Indoor-ALPS on the Augsburg Indoor
   Location Tracking Benchmark and compared our approach to the best
   performing temporal-spatial mobility prediction algorithm, Prediction by
   Partial Match (PPM). Our results show that Indoor-ALPS improves the
   temporalspatial prediction accuracy over PPM for look-aheads up to 90
   minutes by 6.2%, and for up to 30 minute look-aheads by 10.7%. These
   results demonstrate that Indoor-ALPS can be used to support a wide
   variety of indoor mobility prediction-based applications.

AB Existing location-based social networks (LBSNs), e.g. Foursquare, depend
   mainly on GPS or network-based localization to infer users' locations.
   However, GPS is unavailable indoors and network-based localization
   provides coarsegrained accuracy. This limits the accuracy of current
   LBSNs in indoor environments, where people spend 89% of their time. This
   in turn affects the user experience, in terms of the accuracy of the
   ranked list of venues, especially for the small-screens of mobile
   devices; misses business opportunities; and leads to reduced venues
   coverage.
   In this paper, we present CheckInside: a system that can provide a
   fine-grained indoor location-based social network. CheckInside leverages
   the crowd-sensed data collected from users' mobile devices during the
   check-in operation and knowledge extracted from current LBSNs to
   associate a place with its name and semantic fingerprint. This semantic
   fingerprint is used to obtain a more accurate list of nearby places as
   well as automatically detect new places with similar signatures. A novel
   algorithm for handling incorrect check-ins and inferring a
   semantically-enriched floorplan is proposed as well as an algorithm for
   enhancing the system performance based on the user implicit feedback.
   Evaluation of CheckInside in four malls over the course of six weeks
   with 20 participants shows that it can provide the actual user location
   within the top five venues 99% of the time. This is compared to 17% only
   in the case of current LBSNs. In addition, it can increase the coverage
   of current LBSNs by more than 25%.

AB Automatic check-in, which is to identify a user's visited points of
   interest (POIs) from his or her trajectories, is still an open problem
   because of positioning errors and the high POI density in small areas.
   In this study, we propose a probabilistic visited-POI identification
   method. The method uses a new hierarchical Bayesian model for
   identifying the latent visited-POI label of stay points, which are
   automatically extracted from trajectories. This model learns from
   labeled and unlabeled stay point data (i.e., semi-supervised learning)
   and takes into account personal preferences, stay locations including
   positioning errors, stay times for each category, and prior knowledge
   about typical user preferences and stay times. Experimental results with
   real user trajectories and POIs of Foursquare demonstrated that our
   method achieved statistically significant improvements in precision at 1
   and recall at 3 over the nearest neighbor method and a conventional
   method that uses a supervised learning-to-rank algorithm.

   shortcoming, we tackle two interrelated challenges. First, we develop a

AB Trajectory prediction is widespread in mobile computing, and helps
   support wireless network operation, location-based services, and
   applications in pervasive computing. However, most prediction methods
   are based on very coarse geometric information such as visited base
   transceiver stations, which cover tens of kilometers. These approaches
   undermine the prediction accuracy, and thus restrict the variety of
   application. Recently, due to the advance and dissemination of mobile
   positioning technology, accurate location tracking has become prevalent.
   The prediction methods based on precise spatiotemporal information are
   then possible. Although the prediction accuracy can be raised, a massive
   amount of data gets involved, which is undoubtedly a huge impact on
   network bandwidth usage. Therefore, employing fine spatiotemporal
   information in an accurate prediction must be efficient. However, this
   problem is not addressed in many prediction methods. Consequently, this
   paper proposes a novel prediction framework that utilizes massive
   spatiotemporal samples efficiently. This is achieved by identifying and
   extracting the information that is beneficial to accurate prediction
   from the samples. The proposed prediction framework circumvents high
   bandwidth consumption while maintaining high accuracy and being
   feasible. The experiments in this study examine the performance of the
   proposed prediction framework. The results show that it outperforms
   other popular approaches.

   picked up and dropped off, which route was taken, and what steps the
   driver took to find a new passenger. In this article, we provide an
   exhaustive survey of the work on mining these traces. We first provide a
   formalization of the data sets, along with an overview of different
   mechanisms for preprocessing the data. We then classify the existing
   work into three main categories: social dynamics, traffic dynamics and
   operational dynamics. Social dynamics refers to the study of the
   collective behaviour of a city's population, based on their observed
   movements; Traffic dynamics studies the resulting flow of the movement
   through the road network; Operational dynamics refers to the study and
   analysis of taxi driver's modus operandi. We discuss the different
   problems currently being researched, the various approaches proposed,
   and suggest new avenues of research. Finally, we present a historical
   overview of the research work in this field and discuss which areas hold
   most promise for future research.

AB Modeling of the mobility patterns arising in computer networks requires
   a compact and faithful representation of the mobility data collected
   from observations and measurements of the relevant network applications.
   This data can range from the information on the mobility of the agents
   that are being monitored by a wireless network to mobility information
   of nodes in mobile network applications. In this paper, we examine the
   use of probabilistic context-free grammars as the modeling framework for
   such data. We present a fast algorithm for deriving a concise
   probabilistic context-free grammar from the given training data. The
   algorithm uses an evaluation metric based on Bayesian formula for
   maximizing grammar a posteriori probability given the training data. We
   describe the application of this algorithm in two mobility modeling
   domains: 1) recognizing mobility patterns of monitored agents in
   different event data sets collected by sensor networks, and 2) modeling
   and generating node movements in mobile networks. We also discuss the
   model's performance in simulations utilizing both synthetic and
   real-world mobility traces.

AB We propose a travel route recommendation method that makes use of the
   photographers' histories as held by social photo-sharing sites. Assuming
   that the collection of each photographer's geotagged photos is a
   sequence of visited locations, photo-sharing sites are important sources
   for gathering the location histories of tourists. By following their
   location sequences, we can find representative and diverse travel routes
   that link key landmarks. Recommendations are performed by our
   photographer behavior model, which estimates the probability of a
   photographer visiting a landmark. We incorporate user preference and
   present location information into the probabilistic behavior model by
   combining topic models and Markov models. Based on the photographer
   behavior model, proposed route recommendation method outputs a set of
   personalized travel plans that match the user's preference, present
   location, spare time and transportation means. We demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method using an actual large-scale geotag
   dataset held by Flickr in terms of the prediction accuracy of travel
   behavior.

AB Focus on movement data has increased as a consequence of the larger
   availability of such data due to current GPS, GSM, RFID, and sensors
   techniques. In parallel, interest in movement has shifted from raw
   movement data analysis to more application-oriented ways of analyzing
   segments of movement suitable for the specific purposes of the
   application. This trend has promoted semantically rich trajectories,
   rather than raw movement, as the core object of interest in mobility
   studies. This survey provides the definitions of the basic concepts
   about mobility data, an analysis of the issues in mobility
   datamanagement, and a survey of the approaches and techniques for: (i)
   constructing trajectories from movement tracks, (ii) enriching
   trajectories with semantic information to enable the desired
   interpretations of movements, and (iii) using data mining to analyze
   semantic trajectories and extract knowledge about their characteristics,

   log stands for the log of knowledge or learning experience acquired
   ubiquitously. We construct a ubiquitous learning log system called
   SCROLL (System for Capturing and Reminding of Learning Log). Our
   research focuses on helping learners recall what they have learned
   making use of the learning contexts and learners' learning habits. Our
   measures consist of three main actions, which are to recommend learning
   objects in accordance with both learners' needs and contexts, to detect
   their learning habits using the context history and to prompt them to
   review what they have learned regarding their learning habits. What's
   more, by monitoring learners' reaction on the recommendation or
   prompting, the system can improve its prediction. An experiment was
   conducted to evaluate SCROLL and our method. The results of the
   experiment demonstrate that the learners benefited from the system and
   the context based recommendation and learning habit based prompting also
   motivated them to study more.

AB Mobile user similarity is significant for location-based social network
   services. With the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies,
   research on measuring mobile user similarity based on their trajectories
   has attracted a lot of attention. However, trajectories imply only
   short-term mobile regularities, and thus users' long-term activity
   similarity is difficult to be captured. In this paper, we address the
   problem of mining users' long-term activity similarity based on their
   trajectories. To solve this problem, we propose a two-stage approach. At
   the first stage, the notion of routine activity is proposed to capture
   users' long-term activity regularities. The routine activities of a user
   are extracted from his/her daily trajectories. At the second stage, user
   similarity is calculated hierarchically based on the extracted routine
   activities. Finally, we evaluated our approach based on both real and
   artificial datasets. The experimental results show that users with
   different profiles can be discriminated on the basis of our similarity
   metric, and thus demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2013

AB According to Daniel Kahneman, there are two systems that drive the human
   decision-making process: The intuitive system that performs the fast
   thinking, and the deliberative system that does more logical and slower
   thinking. Inspired by this model, we propose a framework for
   implementing human activity recognition on mobile devices. In this area,
   the mobile app is usually always on and the general challenge is how to
   balance accuracy and energy consumption. However, among existing
   approaches, those based on cellular IDs consume little power but are
   less accurate; those based on GPS/Wi-Fi sampling are accurate often at
   the costs of battery drainage; moreover, previous methods in general do
   riot improve overtime. To address these challenges, our framework
   consists of two modes: In the deliberation mode, the system learns cell
   ID patterns that are trained by existing GPS-/Wi-Fi-based methods; in
   the intuition mode, only the learned cell ID patterns are used for
   activity recognition, which is both accurate and energy efficient;
   system parameters are learned to control the transition from
   deliberation to intuition, when sufficient confidence is gained, and the
   transition from intuition to deliberation, when more training is needed.
   For the scope of this paper, we first elaborate our framework in a
   subproblem in activity recognition, trip detection, which recognizes
   significant places and trips between them. For evaluation, we collected
   real-life traces of six participants over five months. Our experiments
   demonstrated consistent results across different participants in terms
   of accuracy and energy efficiency and, more importantly, its fast
   improvement on energy efficiency over time due to regularities in human
   daily activities.

AB Mobile telephony (e. g., Global System for Mobile Communications [GSM])
   is today's most common communication solution. Due to the specific
   characteristics of mobile communication infrastructure, it can provide
   real added value to the user and various other parties. Location
   information and mobility patterns of subscribers contribute not only to
   emergency planning, general safety, and security, but are also a driving
   force for new commercial services. However, there is a lack of
   transparency in today's mobile telephony networks regarding location
   disclosure. Location information is generated, collected, and processed
   without being noticed by subscribers. Hence, by exploiting subscriber
   location information, an individual's privacy is threatened. We develop
   a utility-based opponent model to formalize the conflict between the
   additional utility of mobile telephony infrastructure being able to
   locate subscribers and the individual's privacy. Based on these results,
   measures were developed to improve an individual's location privacy
   through a user-controllable GSM software stack. To analyze and evaluate
   the effects of specific subscriber provider interaction, a dedicated
   test environment will be presented, using the example of GSM mobile
   telephony networks. The resulting testbed is based on real-life hardware
   and open-source software to create a realistic and defined environment
   that includes all aspects of the air interface in mobile telephony
   networks and thus, is capable of controlling subscriber-provider
   interaction in a defined and fully controlled environment.

AB Sharing geo-tagged photos has been a hot social activity in the daily
   life because these photos not only contain geo information but also
   indicate people's hobbies, intention and mobility patterns. However, the
   present raw geo-tagged photo routes cannot provide information as enough
   as complete GPS trajectories due to the defects hidden in them. This
   paper mainly aims at analyzing the large amounts of geo-tagged photos
   and proposing a novel travel route restoring method. In our approach we
   first propose an Interest Measure Ratio to rank the hot spots based on
   density-based spatial clustering arithmetic. Then we apply the Hidden
   Semi-Markov model and Mean Value method to demonstrate migration
   discipline in the hot spots and restore the significant region sequence
   into complete GPS trajectory. At the end of the paper, a novel
   experiment method is designed to demonstrate that the approach is
   feasible in restoring route, and there is a good performance.

AB Life-space is an emerging method for measuring older adults' functional
   status. Although global positioning system (GPS)-enabled smartphones can
   collect life-space data passively and accurately, researchers lack an
   effective process to derive activity information from the raw GPS data.
   In addition, the influence of GPS retrieving frequency on life-space
   characterization is unknown. We describe a GPS data processing procedure
   to estimate life-space. A cellular telephone was used to collect GPS
   data by a subject during a 4-month period. The GPS data processing
   procedure was then implemented and evaluated in terms of classification
   accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity to observation frequency. The
   proposed scheme generated sufficient zone-based activity information to
   characterize an individual's life-space. The speed-based sensitivity
   assessment suggests 75 s as an appropriate GPS observation interval for
   smartphone based life-space data collection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Research on place extraction has been of interest for the detection of
   meaningful places that users visit. Because interpretations of
   meaningful places may be different according to location-based
   applications, a universal place extraction algorithm that is able to
   detect all kinds of meaningful places needs to be developed.
   Unfortunately, most previously proposed place extraction algorithms
   failed to show high place detection accuracy and also failed to
   perfectly detect meaningful places. In this work, we propose a new place
   extraction algorithm that can significantly enhance the accuracy of
   place extraction. The basic concept of the proposed algorithm is a
   superstate model, which is an extension of the Hidden Markov Model
   (HMM); we substituted superstates for the simple probabilistic
   distributions of the HMM. Our proposed algorithm shows remarkable
   detection accuracy in place extraction, significantly higher than any
   other previously proposed algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed
   algorithm can efficiently operate in mobile environments because its
   computations are simple.

AB Background: Health studies and mHealth applications are increasingly
   resorting to tracking technologies such as Global Positioning Systems
   (GPS) to study the relation between mobility, exposures, and health. GPS
   tracking generates large sets of geographic data that need to be
   transformed to be useful for health research. This paper proposes a
   method to test the performance of activity place detection algorithms,
   and compares the performance of a novel kernel-based algorithm with a
   more traditional time-distance cluster detection method.
   Methods: A set of 750 artificial GPS tracks containing three stops each
   were generated, with various levels of noise.. A total of 9,000 tracks
   were processed to measure the algorithms' capacity to detect stop
   locations and estimate stop durations, with varying GPS noise and
   algorithm parameters.
   Results: The proposed kernel-based algorithm outperformed the
   traditional algorithm on most criteria associated to activity place
   detection, and offered a stronger resilience to GPS noise, managing to
   detect up to 92.3% of actual stops, and estimating stop duration within
   5% error margins at all tested noise levels.
   Conclusions: Capacity to detect activity locations is an important
   feature in a context of increasing use of GPS devices in health and
   place research. While further testing with real-life tracks is
   recommended, testing algorithms' performance with artificial track sets
   for which characteristics are controlled is useful. The proposed novel
   algorithm outperformed the traditional algorithm under these conditions.

AB The mobile end user context has received a lot of attention from the
   mobile services industry lately. The location-based and
   context-sensitive information that are characteristic for smartphones
   can be utilized to study the use context of mobile end users.
   Accordingly, this article utilizes handset-based data in analyzing how
   the context of use affects the usage of smartphone communication
   services. The context is identified with an algorithm utilizing mobile
   network cell ID and WLAN data and resulting in five place-related
   contexts, namely Home, Office, Other meaningful, Elsewhere and Abroad.
   According to our analysis, voice calls are used least intensively in the
   Home context where the length of the voice calls is the longest,
   however. Email and SMS are used most intensively in the Office context,
   where the voice calls are the shortest in duration. Finally, mobile
   IM/VoIP and social media services are more free-time oriented as they
   are used most intensively in Elsewhere and Other meaningful contexts.
   The findings imply that people use smartphone communication services
   differently depending on the use context. However, context can be
   defined and identified in a number of ways, and this article presents
   only one solution that is highly dependent on the type of data
   collected.

   defined. In this paper, we approach the problem from the most basic of
   starting points, namely by analyzing the real Global Positioning System
   datasets of human mobility traces. On this elementary basis, the paper
   provides a few relevant contributions. We firstly derive a deep
   understanding of the term location and at the same time of the notion of
   community strictly related to it. Secondly, we merge the two concepts
   into what we call geo-community. By proceeding from real spatial data
   rather than from a priori reasonings, we are able to quantitatively
   describe geo-communities and infer the probability distributions of all
   the features of human behavior. Finally, not to lose social
   implications, we present the method to derive people sociality from
   geo-communities. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A route trajectory is described as the upcoming course of the road in
   geographical terms as well as in terms of time. This enables the
   possibility of providing context-aware applications in modern vehicles.
   In order to generate such a trajectory with its context aware
   information, it is still necessary to enter a destination point into a
   navigation system. However, the most frequent commutations (drives,
   trips) are to known destinations and are therefore not performed with
   any active guidance system. This means that the prediction must be
   determined in a different manner. This paper presents a method, which
   predicts the route trajectory of a vehicle based on the travel history
   of its user. In addition to the traveled distance further context
   parameters are used for the prediction. These parameters include the
   current time of day, day of week and the route frequency, which
   indicates the number of times a particular route has already been
   traveled. Moreover, the developed prediction is evaluated in a
   volunteers study with about 500 rides and about 9.500 driven kilometers.
   The results show that in 80 percent of the cases the forward-lying path
   can be predicted correctly.

AB Knowing user's current or next location is very important task for
   context-aware services in mobile environment. Many researchers have
   tried to predict user location using their own methods. However, they
   focused mainly the performance of method, and only few were considered
   development of real working system on mobile devices. In this paper, we
   present a location prediction framework, and develop a personalized
   destination prediction system based on this framework using smartphone.
   The framework consists of two methods of recognizing user location based
   on the combined method of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and decision tree,
   and predicting user destination based on the hidden Markov model (HMM).
   The destination prediction system is composed of four parts including
   mobile sensor log collector, location recognition module, location
   prediction module, and system management module. Experiments on real
   datasets of five persons showed that our method achieved average
   prediction accuracy above 87%.

AB Location information is becoming much more important than ever before,
   especially in mobile services. Being widespread, less cost of energy and
   almost free for collecting data make mobile phone a perfect location
   sensor probe. Meaningful location name rather than digital coordinates
   could provide much more valuable information. In this paper, we develop
   a location semantic predicting method referred to Location
   Annotation(LA) which can automatically annotate meaningful base stations
   of phone users with semantic tags such as "home","work place" and
   "club". We extract several explicit features from phone records and
   spatial-temporal patterns of mobile phone users to build an annotation
   model based on Maximum Entropy Model. Then a machine learning method is
   presented to estimate the best configuration of parameters in the model.
   Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate good performance of our
   method. Overall accuracy is about 90% which outperforms simple and
   traditional classification methods by 10+%. Semantic location names are
   valuable to urban planning and optimization, transportation management
   and land use planning.

AB GPS-based activity recognition is extremely important for high-level
   analysis and location based services. Trajectories of people are highly
   imbalanced from spatial and temporal perspectives. Many existing
   researches achieve good results on recognizing activities with lots of
   GPS logs, such as working and staying at home. However, these approaches
   usually fail at activities with few trajectory records. In this paper,
   we propose a cost sensitive GPS-based activity recognition model to
   improve accuracy of minority activities which could imply users'
   personal preferences. The approach aims at providing more balanced
   results. We first propose a cost function to measure spatial and
   temporal regularities of each activity on a stay point. Then we
   incorporate cost function into activity recognition algorithm. We take
   hidden Markov model as an example in this study. Experiments show good
   performance of our approach in several evaluation metrics. It could
   provide more balanced and valuable activity recognition results from GPS
   trajectories.

AB Understanding and predicting destination of a trip is a crucial
   component of location based services. Traditional destination prediction
   work mostly focus on mining mobility patterns from frequently been
   locations. However, location transition patterns are not regular enough
   to provide favorable predicting results. Meanwhile, it could only be
   used when a user has enough movements in a location. In this paper, we
   propose a hierarchical model which predict what to do first and where to
   go in next. We first demonstrate that activity transitions are more
   regular than location transitions. Then we employ a Hidden Markov Model
   (HMM) based predicting approach which takes user's activity transition
   into account. We introduce a supervised way to learn parameters for HMM.
   Experimental results show that hierarchical prediction scheme could
   improve accuracy of pre-destination. Hierarchical model could perform
   well in some situations that traditional methods are of poor accuracy.

AB The advance of GPS tracking technique brings a large amount of
   trajectory data. These data can be used in many application domains such
   as traffic management, urban planning, tourism, and bird migration.
   Recently, a semantic model which expresses trajectory as a sequence of
   stops and moves was introduced and become a hot topic for trajectory
   data analysis. Stops are important parts of trajectories, such as
   "working at office", "shopping in a mall", "waiting for the bus".
   Although several works have been developed to discover stops, they
   considered the characteristics of the stops separately. Because of this
   limitation, these approaches only focus on certain well-defined
   trajectories. They cannot work well for heterogeneous cases like diverse
   and sparse trajectories. Towards stop discovery in trajectories, in this
   paper, we propose a comprehensive hybrid feature-based method to
   discover stops. We also evaluate our approach with real-life GPS
   datasets, and show that this newly proposed approach can provide a good
   abstraction on the trajectory, with efficient computation.

AB With the advent of GPS-equipped devices, a massive amount of location
   data is being collected, raising the issue of the privacy risks incurred
   by the individuals whose movements are recorded. In this work, we focus
   on a specific inference attack called the de-anonymization attack, by
   which an adversary tries to infer the identity of a particular
   individual behind a set of mobility traces. More specifically, we
   propose an implementation of this attack based on a mobility model
   called Mobility Markov Chain (MMC). A MMC is built out from the mobility
   traces observed during the training phase and is used to perform the
   attack during the testing phase. We design two distance metrics
   quantifying the closeness between two MMCs and combine these distances
   to build de-anonymizers that can re-identify users in an anonymized
   geolocated dataset. Experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate
   that the attack is both accurate and resilient to sanitization
   mechanisms such as downsampling.

AB Algorithms that can reliably predict the next location visited by a user
   can enable a large number of applications. The accuracy that can be
   achieved by these algorithms depends on the inherent characteristics of
   the mobility pattern of the user, i.e., on its predictability. Recent
   studies have shown the theoretical limits of human predictability and
   have provided a sound mathematical framework to compute predictability
   bounds using the entropy of the sequence of locations visited by the
   user. However, most of the existing results focus on the
   characterization of the predictability over long periods of time, e. g.,
   a few weeks. For several applications, though, knowledge of the
   momentary predictability, i.e., the predictability at a given time
   instant k is required. To this end, a novel metric called Instantaneous
   Entropy (IE) has been introduced in the literature. In this paper, we
   investigate the actual suitability of the IE metric to characterize the
   momentary predictability. We provide quantitative results to show that
   IE can estimate the momentary predictability of human mobility only to a
   limited extent, i.e., as long as unfavorable situations do not appear in
   the sequence of historical locations visited by the user. Our analysis
   is based on both real human mobility traces and synthetically generated
   data.

AB With approx. 6 million macro cells worldwide and a gross energy
   consumption of approx. 100 TWh per year as of 2013, mobile networks are
   one of the major energy consumers in the ICT sector. As trends, such as
   cloud-based services and other traffic-intensive mobile applications,
   fuel the growth of mobile traffic demands, operators of mobile telephony
   networks are forced to continuously extend the capacity of the existing
   infrastructure by both implementing new technologies as well as by
   installing new cell towers to provide more bandwidth for mobile users
   and improve the network's coverage. In order to implement
   energy-efficient reconfiguration mechanisms in mobile telephony networks
   as proposed by the project Communicate Green, it is essential to
   anticipate traffic hotspots, so that a network's configuration can be
   adjusted in time accordingly. Hence, predicting the movement of mobile
   users on a cellular level of the mobile network is a crucial task. In
   this paper, we propose a Movement Prediction System based on the
   algorithm of Yavas et al. that allows to determine the future movement
   of a user on a cellular level using precomputed movement patterns. We
   extended the algorithm to be capable of preselecting patterns based on
   time and contextual data in order to improve prediction accuracy. The
   performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on real and live user
   movement data from the OpenMobileNetwork, which is a platform providing
   estimated mobile network topology data. We found that the algorithm's
   prediction quality is sufficient, but requires an extensive amount of
   recorded user movements to perform well.

   gaining attention. Instead of actively sampling increasing volumes of
   sensor data, we explore the participatory sensing potential of multiple
   mobile social networks, on which users often disclose information about
   their location and the venues they visit. In this paper, we present
   automated techniques for filtering, aggregating, and processing combined
   social networking traces with the goal of extracting descriptions of
   regularly-occurring user activities, which we refer to as "user
   routines". We report our findings based on two localized data sets about
   a single pool of users: the former contains public geo-tagged Twitter
   messages, the latter Foursquare check-ins that provide us with
   meaningful venue information about the locations we observe. We analyze
   and combine the two datasets to highlight their properties and show how
   the emergent features can enhance our understanding of users' daily
   schedule. Finally, we evaluate and discuss the potential of routine
   descriptions for predicting future user activity and location.

AB Context aware systems on smart-phones aim to provide useful information
   by analysing and recognizing users' situations from built-in sensors
   logs. Especially, predicting user actions is one of the important
   functions for the context aware systems on smart-phones because this
   function enables context aware systems to provide proactive and
   responsive services. Therefore the next location prediction is also an
   important function for context aware systems. This paper introduces a
   next location prediction method based on context recognition. In this
   method, we define a context as combinations of features which are
   extracted from a set of relational data generated from a phone's sensor
   logs. We applied Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels (MMSB) to
   context extraction. We then collected sensor logs of a single user over
   a period of three months and conducted an evaluation using this
   collected dataset. An an evaluation using the dataset was conducted and
   the result shows that 60% of the test dataset ranked in the top 30% of
   all candidates of the next locations.

AB Destination prediction is an essential task for many emerging location
   based applications such as recommending sightseeing places and targeted
   advertising based on destination. A common approach to destination
   prediction is to derive the probability of a location being the
   destination based on historical trajectories. However, existing
   techniques using this approach suffer from the "data sparsity problem",
   i.e., the available historical trajectories is far from being able to
   coverall possible trajectories. This problem considerably limits the
   number of query trajectories that can obtain predicted destinations. We
   propose a novel method named Sub-Trajectory Synthesis(SubSyn) algorithm
   to address the data sparsity problem. SubSyn algorithm first decomposes
   historical trajectories into sub-trajectories comprising two
   neighbouring locations,and then connects the sub-trajectories into
   "synthesised" trajectories. The number of query trajectories that can
   have predicted destinations is exponentially increased by this means.
   Experiments based on real datasets show that SubSyn algorithm can
   predict destinations for upto ten times more query trajectories than a
   baseline algorithm while the SubSyn prediction algorithm runs over two
   orders of magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm. In this paper,we
   also consider the privacy protection issue in case an adversary uses
   SubSyn algorithm to derive sensitive location information of users. We
   propose an efficient algorithm to select a minimum number of locations a
   user has to hide on her trajectory in order to avoid privacy leak.
   Experiments also validate the high efficiency of the privacy protection
   algorithm.

AB In this paper, we take the position that location and information
   derived from location adds value to health and wellness logs.
   Traditional health and wellness logs such as food and physical activity
   diaries do not include location information in a meaningful way. As the
   ability to track and make sense of location is improving, it will be
   possible to associate high-quality data regarding the user location and
   location-derived activities to health and wellness logs. This can
   significantly improve the ability of these logs to expose meaning to the
   user, specifically around food and physical activity behaviors. We
   address four dimensions of location related information: location in
   terms of places and travels; information derived from location such as
   roles and transitions; routines identified from places and place
   transitions; and finally, identifying cohorts and aggregating over
   routines.

AB Continuous personal position information has been attracting attention
   in a variety of service and research areas. In recent years, many
   studies have applied the telecommunication histories of mobile phones
   (CDRs: call detail records) to position acquisition. Although
   large-scale and long-term data are accumulated from CDRs through
   everyday use of mobile phones, the spatial resolution of CDRs is lower
   than that of existing positioning technologies. Therefore, interpolating
   spatiotemporal positions of such sparse CDRs in accordance with human
   behavior models will facilitate services and researches. In this paper,
   we propose a new method to compensate for CDR drawbacks in tracking
   positions. We generate as many candidate routes as possible in the
   spatiotemporal domain using trip patterns interpolated using road and
   railway networks and select the most likely route from them. Trip
   patterns are feasible combinations between stay places that are detected
   from individual location histories in CDRs. The most likely route could
   be estimated through comparing candidate routes to observed CDRs during
   a target day. We also show the assessment of our method using CDRs and
   GPS logs obtained in the experimental survey.

AB Mobile recommender systems target on recommending the right product or
   information to the right mobile users at anytime and anywhere. It is
   well known that the contextual information is often the key for the
   performances of mobile recommendations. Therefore, in this paper, we
   provide a focused survey of the recent development of context-aware
   mobile recommendations. After briefly reviewing the state-of-the-art of
   recommender systems, we first discuss the general notion of mobile
   context and how the contextual information is collected. Then, we
   introduce the existing approaches to exploit contextual information for
   modeling mobile recommendations. Furthermore, we summarize several
   existing recommendation tasks in the mobile scenarios, such as the
   recommendations in the tourism domain. Finally, we discuss some key
   issues that are still critical in the field of context-aware mobile
   recommendations, including the privacy problem, the energy efficiency
   issues, and the design of user interfaces.
