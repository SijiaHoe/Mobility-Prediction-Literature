AB Geo-spatial data with geographical information explodes as the
   development of GPS-devices. The data contains certain patterns of users.
   To dig out the patterns behind the data efficiently, a grid-growing
   clustering algorithm is introduced. The proposed algorithm takes use of
   a grid structure, and a novel clustering operation is presented, which
   considers a grid growing method on the grid structure. The grid
   structure brings the benefit of efficiency. For large geo-spatial data,
   the algorithm has competitive strength on the running time. The total
   time complexity of the algorithm is O(N log N), where the time
   complexity mainly comes from the seed selection step. The grid-growing
   clustering algorithm is useful when the number of clusters is unknown
   since the algorithm requires no parameter on the number of clusters. The
   clusters detected could have arbitrary shapes. Furthermore, sparse areas
   are treated as outliers/noises in the algorithm. An empirical study on
   several data sets indicates that the proposed algorithm works much more
   efficiently than other popular clustering algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB Smartphones are nowadays used for recognizing people's daily activities
   and habits, by collecting and analysing user activity information in
   real-time. In order to demonstrate this methodology, we have developed
   GPSTracker1 a prototype application for Android phones, which collects
   position, speed, altitude and time information and performs real-time
   classification of user's movement. The GPSTracker application also uses
   geo-location information abouts Points Of Interest (POIs) such as bus or
   metro routes, parks and stadiums in order to improve the set of features
   used for the classification of a type of movement. In this work, we use
   evolutionary algorithms, in order to reduce the number of samples
   required for training our classifier, without loosing in classification
   accuracy. The resulting model, a) is able to provide personalized
   solutions, tuned to each individual users movement abilities, b) better
   adapts to unbalanced training data, due to the generation of training
   samples from the existing ones, c) performs an initial sampling of the
   training data, which reduces requirements for computational resources
   and improves the classification performance.

AB In recent years, the widespread adoption of GPS enabled vehicles brings
   the Location Based Services new opportunities. It benefits many related
   fields such as urban planning, city traffic modeling, personalized
   recommendations and driving suggestions. The service providers can
   understand their users better by modeling the mobility pattern and
   provide more personalized services by predicting the destination of
   users' travels. In this paper, we propose to model both the temporal and
   spatial mobility patterns of human movements and predict the user's
   travel destination from certain origin place at certain time with
   specific IOHMM. In order to account for data missing, we introduce a
   dummy state in the process of constructing the IOHMM data sequence. We
   also demonstrate the possibility to represent individual mobility
   preference by building the user mobility profiles with the learnt IOHMM.
   We evaluate the prediction accuracy of our method with two datasets, and
   the experimental results show that our method outperforms several
   state-of-the-art works on both datasets.

AB The pervasive nature of location-aware hardware has provided an
   unprecedented foundation for understanding human behaviour. With a
   record of historic movement, in the form of geospatial trajectories,
   extracting locations meaningful to users is commonly performed as a
   basis for modelling a users' interactions with their environment.
   Existing literature, however, has scarcely considered the applicability
   of extracted locations, typically focusing solely on the consequent
   knowledge acquisition process employed, due to the difficulty of
   evaluating the output of such unsupervised learning techniques. Towards
   the goal of ensuring the representativeness of extracted locations, and
   using location prediction as an example knowledge acquisition process,
   this work provides a method of automated parameter selection for both
   location extraction and prediction that ensures both the applicability
   of the locations extracted and the utility of the predictions performed.
   Specifically, we: (i) provide a metric for the evaluation of both
   extracted locations and predictions that characterises the goal of each
   of these tasks, (ii) frame the process of parameter selection as that of
   mathematical optimisation through the presented metric, and (iii)
   discuss characteristics of the metric while demonstrating its
   applicability over real-world data, location extraction algorithms and
   prediction techniques.

   assignment of chunks based on Reed-Solomon erasure code. Then we propose
   to solve the optimization problem by a mixed integer linear programming
   (MILP). The efficiency and effectiveness of this context-aware mechanism

   different reviews of popular places from multiple visitors is an
   explicit way to help Recommender System to rate these places. A Genetic

   System sorts the rated places in descending order by their rates. The
   places that have the highest rates in most number of users are
   recommended by the system. Collaborative Recommender system advises the
   user to go to the best place via mobile according to other users'
   preferences in places and the nearest place from user's location. Then
   the system shows the direction to this place on the map via user's

AB Location prediction based on cellular network traces is a very
   challenging task due to the randomness of the human mobility patterns.
   With the help of the abundant social interaction data contained in the
   cellular network, this paper focus on this question: How can knowing the
   location and the assembled and dismissed behavior of my friends be used
   to more accurately predict my location?
   In this paper, we focus on how the collective effect users' mobility. We
   notice an interesting rule that users tend to stay around the places
   where their friends are denser. Those places where friends are more
   crowned is chosen for a reason, either they are having a meeting there
   or they gathered spontaneously because of sharing office building or
   other resources. With known locations of friends, we established a
   location prediction model to make full use of those social information.
   In this model, we also introduced a measure of the ability of each
   location that weather a gathering of friends here can attract the user.
   The result shows that this model did improve location prediction at the
   average of 4.91%, and max improvement up to about 42.9%. And we
   summarize the feature and the difference between the kinds of users
   whose behavior is following his friends a lot from those user who move
   around more independently.

PY 2015
AB We look into the realization of mobile crowdsensing campaigns that draw
   on the opportunistic networking paradigm, as practised in delay-tolerant
   networks but also in the emerging device-to-device communication mode in
   cellular networks. In particular, we ask how mobile users can be
   optimally selected in order to generate the required space-time paths
   across the network for collecting data from a set of fixed locations.
   The users hold different roles in these paths, from collecting data with
   their sensing-enabled devices to relaying them across the network and
   uploading them to data collection points with Internet connectivity. We
   first consider scenarios with deterministic node mobility and formulate
   the selection of users as a minimum-cost set cover problem with a
   submodular objective function. We then generalize to more realistic
   settings with uncertainty about the user mobility. A methodology is
   devised for translating the statistics of individual user mobility to
   statistics of space-time path formation and feeding them to the set
   cover problem formulation. We describe practical greedy heuristics for
   the resulting NP-hard problems and compute their approximation ratios.
   Our experimentation with real mobility datasets (a) illustrates the
   multiple tradeoffs between the campaign cost and duration, the bound on
   the hopcount of space-time paths, and the number of collection points;
   and (b) provides evidence that in realistic problem instances the
   heuristics perform much better than what their pessimistic worst-case
   bounds suggest.

AB We present a place-history-based activity prediction system called
   Agatha, in order to enable activity-aware mobile services in smart
   cities. The system predicts a user's potential subsequent activities
   that are highly likely to occur given a series of information about
   activities done before or activity-related contextual information such
   as visit place and time. To predict the activities, we develop a
   causality-based activity prediction model using Bayesian networks. The
   basic idea of the prediction is that where a person has been and what
   he/she has done so far influence what he/she will do next. To show the
   feasibility, we evaluate the prediction model using the American
   Time-Use Survey (ATUS) dataset, which includes more than 10,000 people's
   location and activity history. Our evaluation shows that Agatha can
   predict users' potential activities with up to 90% accuracy for the top
   3 activities, more than 80% for the top 2 activities, and about 65% for
   the top 1 activity while considering a relatively large number of daily
   activities defined in the ATUS dataset, that is, 17 activities.

AB Purpose - The aim of this paper is to empirically examine how to best
   incorporate such contextual data, such as location or the semantic place
   of mobile users, into mobile user behavior models. Acquiring such data
   has become technically easier than ever. The proper utilization of these
   data leads, hypothetically, to better understanding of mobile user
   behavior and, consequently, to enhanced mobile services.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper systematically compares, under
   multiple experimental settings, the predictive performances of models
   built with three different approaches (pre-filtering, contextual
   modeling and post-filtering) used for incorporating contextual data into
   user behavior models. The comparisons focus on by which approach
   additional semantic place information can be best utilized for making
   the most accurate inferences on mobile user behavior. Real-life
   smartphone usage data are utilized in the analysis.
   Findings - The results demonstrate that none of the considered
   approaches uniformly dominate the others across all experimental
   settings. However, they show circumstance specific differences that need
   to be aligned with practical use cases for the best performance.
   Practical implications - Identifying the most suitable approaches for
   utilizing the semantic place (and other contextual) data is an important
   practical problem for electronic service providers, whose offerings are
   increasingly moving to the mobile domain and thus need to respond to the
   demands of mobility.
   Originality/value - The paper constitutes an initial step toward
   understanding and systematically evaluating different approaches for
   incorporating semantic place data into modeling mobile user behavior.
   Practitioners in the mobile service domain can apply the initial results
   and academics build upon them with more diverse experimental settings.

AB Context prediction plays a vital role in an assistive ubiquitous
   environment. The environmental configuration in a ubiquitous environment
   is heavily dependent on the context of the events occurring in the
   environment. Current state of the art approaches utilize the user's
   history information for predicting the context of the events. When the
   user's history does not provide apposite contextual information for the
   observed activity/event at time t, the history based state of the art
   context prediction techniques fails to predict the appropriate future
   context. To overcome the gap of missing context information in the
   user's context history, we propose a Profile based Collaborative Context
   Prediction (PCCP) approach. PCCP is a predictive association rules based
   system which utilizes the history of similar users and collaborate among
   users of the ubiquitous environment. PCCP generates rules at high level
   of abstraction, human readable and understandable that helps in avoiding
   the underline details. To evaluate the PCCP, a smart office is
   considered as an experimental environment. Experiments are carried out
   on indigenous multi user smart office data set. Our experiments showed
   significant level of accuracy in both environments. Due to the
   understandability of output and higher accuracy of PCCP, it can be
   extended to assist the user in a smart environment.

AB Location-based social network has received much attention recently. It
   provides rich information of social and spatial context for researchers
   to study users' behaviors from different aspects. A number of recent
   efforts focus on recommending locations, users, activities, and social
   medias for users. Unlike previous works, we intend to make
   recommendations for vendors, assisting vendors in finding potential
   customers in location-based social network. We propose a framework to
   recommend potential customers to vendors (called RPCV) in location-based
   social network effectively and efficiently. To find the best set of
   customers, RPCV takes both spatial relations and user preference into
   consideration. A reverse spatial-preference kRanks algorithm, which
   effectively combines spatial relations with user preference, is also
   proposed. Our experimental results on real datasets from Foursquare and
   Brightkite show that our framework has higher performance than other
   state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Location is one of the most commonly used contextual information in
   mobile context-aware systems. It can be considered on many different
   levels of granularity, varying from geolocation that is based on GPS
   systems, up to microlocation that uses Bluetooth Low Energy devices and
   WiFi access points for locating users inside buildings. Most common use
   of location is navigation, however recently it is more often considered
   also as an important component of the user profile. One of the biggest
   challenges in location-based context-aware systems is the discovery of
   patterns in user transportation traces and extraction of the most often
   visited places. In this paper we presented and evaluated a method that
   allows for automatic extraction of clusters from user location traces.
   These clusters represents user points of interest like home, work,
   favourite restaurants, but also transportation routines. The original
   contribution of this work is a proposal of an approach based on the
   K-means clustering algorithm equipped with a module for automatic
   discovery of number of clusters and density-based cluster merging. This
   method allows for online, adaptable discovery of user points of
   interests, and transportation routines in mobile systems.

AB Immense amount of data containing information about preferences of users
   can be shared with the help of WWW and mobile devices. The pervasiveness
   of location acquisition technologies like Global Positioning System
   (GPS) has enabled the convenient logging of movement histories of users.
   GPS logs are good source to extract information about user's preferences
   and interests. In this paper, we first aim to discover and learn
   individual user's preferences for various locations they have visited in
   the past by analyzing and mining the user's GPS logs. We have used the
   GPS trajectory dataset of 178 users collected by Microsoft Research
   Asia's GeoLife project collected in a period of over four years. These
   preferences are further used to predict individual's interest in an
   unvisited location. We have proposed a novel approach based on Genetic
   Algorithm (GA) to model the interest of user for unvisited location. The
   two approaches have been implemented using Java and MATLAB and the
   results are compared for evaluation. The recommendation results of
   proposed approach are comparable with matrix factorization based
   approach and shows improvement of 4.1 % (approx.) on average root mean
   squared error (RMSE).

AB Mobile Opportunistic Network (MON) is characterized by intermittent
   connectivity where communication largely depends on the mobility pattern
   of the participating nodes. In MON, a node can take the custody of a
   packet for a long time and carry it until a new forwarding path has been
   established, unlike mobile adhoc network (MANET), where a node must drop
   the packet otherwise. Therefore, routing in MON depends on the repeated
   make-and-break of communication links, which again depends on the
   mobility of the nodes as they encounter and drift away from each other.
   MONs can simply be formed by humans carrying hand-held devices (like
   Personal Digital Assistant [PDAs] or cell phones) or on-board devices
   installed in vehicles. Therefore, with mobility playing a major role in
   the performance of MON, researchers have repeatedly tried to understand
   the nature of mobility with respect to humans, vehicles, and wild
   animals. To study the nature of mobility, researchers have collected
   mobility traces, proposed mobility models, and analyzed the performance
   of MON with respect to various mobility parameters. This article
   provides a detailed survey of different mobility models which have been
   proposed to date and how mobility largely determines the performance of
   opportunistic routing. We divide the article into four major sections.
   First, we provide a detailed survey of all the synthetic mobility models
   which have been developed to date. Second, we study the various mobility
   traces which have been collected and analyzed. Third, we study how
   mobility parameters affect the performance of MON. Finally, we highlight
   on some of the research areas and open challenges which yet remain
   unsolved.

AB Today, the urban computing scenario is emerging as a concept where
   humans can be used as a component to probe city dynamics. The urban
   activities can be described by the close integration of ICT devices and
   humans. In the quest for creating sustainable livable cities, the deep
   understanding of urban mobility and space syntax is of crucial
   importance. This research aims to explore and demonstrate the vast
   potential of using large-scale mobile-phone GPS data for analysis of
   human activity and urban connectivity. A new type of mobile sensing data
   called "Auto-GPS" has been anonymously collected from 1.5 million people
   for a period of over one year in Japan. The analysis delivers some
   insights on interim evolution of population density, urban connectivity
   and commuting choice. The results enable urban planners to better
   understand the urban organism with more complete inclusion of urban
   activities and their evolution through space and time.

AB Predicting the location of a mobile user in the near future can be used
   for a large number of user-centred ubiquitous applications. This can be
   extended to crowd-centred applications if a large number of users is
   included. In this paper we present a spatio-temporal prediction approach
   to forecast user location in a medium-term period. Our approach is based
   on the hypothesis that users exhibit a different mobility pattern for
   each day of the week. Once factored out this weekly pattern, user
   mobility among points of interest is postulated to be markovian. We
   trained a hidden Markov model to forecast user mobility and evaluated
   our approach using a public dataset. The experimental results show that
   our approach is effective considering a time period of up to 7 h. We
   obtained an accuracy of up to 81.75% for a period of 30 min, and 66.25%
   considering 7 h.

   Taking into account the increasing number of sensors vehicles are

   the context of a vehicle by processing and fusioning the data of some of
   them. As a result, an on-board context-aware application that processes
   the usual itineraries of the Ego Vehicle as part of the vehicular
   context has been implemented. Particularly, the system follows a Complex
   Event Processing (CEP) approach, and it is able to detect the vehicular
   occupancy along with the meaningful points of the frequent itineraries
   whereby a density-based-cluster algorithm. Test results from simulations
   and real environments show the accuracy of the system when it comes to
   detect different types of itineraries. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   i.e. the places or areas where they stop to perform any kind of
   activities. Correctly discovering such personal locations is therefore a
   very important problem, which is yet not very well addressed in
   literature. In this work we propose a robust, efficient, statistically
   well-founded and parameter-free personal location detection process. The
   algorithm, called TOSCA (TwO-Steps parameter free Clustering Algorithm),
   combines two clustering strategies and applies statistical tests to
   drive the selection of the needed parameters. The proposed solution is
   tested against a large set of competitors and several datasets,
   including synthetic and real ones. The empirical results show its
   ability to automatically adapt to different contexts yielding good
   accuracy and a good efficiency.

AB Quantifying human mobility has significant consequences for studying
   physical activity, exposure to pathogens, and generating more realistic
   infectious disease models. Location-aware technologies such as Global
   Positioning System (GPS)-enabled devices are used increasingly as a gold
   standard for mobility research. The main goal of this observational
   study was to compare and contrast the information obtained through GPS
   and semi-structured interviews (SSI) to assess issues affecting data
   quality and, ultimately, our ability to measure fine-scale human
   mobility. A total of 160 individuals, ages 7 to 74, from Iquitos, Peru,
   were tracked using GPS data-loggers for 14 days and later interviewed
   using the SSI about places they visited while tracked. A total of 2,047
   and 886 places were reported in the SSI and identified by GPS,
   respectively. Differences in the concordance between methods occurred by
   location type, distance threshold (within a given radius to be
   considered a match) selected, GPS data collection frequency (i.e., 30,
   90 or 150 seconds) and number of GPS points near the SSI place
   considered to define a match. Both methods had perfect concordance
   identifying each participant's house, followed by 80-100% concordance
   for identifying schools and lodgings, and 50-80% concordance for
   residences and commercial and religious locations. As the distance
   threshold selected increased, the concordance between SSI and raw GPS
   data increased (beyond 20 meters most locations reached their maximum
   concordance). Processing raw GPS data using a signal-clustering
   algorithm decreased overall concordance to 14.3%. The most common causes
   of discordance as described by a sub-sample (n = 101) with whom we
   followed-up were GPS units being accidentally off (30%), forgetting or
   purposely not taking the units when leaving home (24.8%), possible
   barriers to the signal (4.7%) and leaving units home to recharge (4.6%).
   We provide a quantitative assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of
   both methods for capturing fine-scale human mobility.

   refined path estimate. The experimental results conducted on the
   large-scale HKUST campus demonstrate that the SCaNME tracking system
   provides better precision and reliability than the conventional location

AB Recent developments in pervasive location acquisition technologies
   provide the technical support for massive collection of trajectory data.
   Activity locations identified from trajectory data can be used to
   evaluate space-time activity patterns. However, the studies that explore
   activity patterns at collective levels often fail to address the
   temporal aspect. The traditional spatial statistics, which are commonly
   used for spatial pattern analysis, are limited in describing space-time
   interactions. This paper proposes a method to detect the dynamics of
   space-time development of urban activity patterns that are embedded in
   large volume trajectory data. Taxi cabs' trajectory data in the city of
   San Francisco were analyzed to identify activity instances, activity hot
   spots, and space-time dynamics of activity hot spots. The urban activity
   hot spots, evolving through different stages and across the city,
   provide a comprehensive depiction of the space-time activity patterns in
   the urban landscape. The dynamic patterns of the activity hot spots can
   be used to retrieve historical events and to predict future activity hot
   spots, which may be valuable for transportation and public safety
   management.

AB Travel recommendation and travel diary generation applications can
   benefit significantly from methods that infer the durations and
   locations of visits from travelers' GPS data. However, conventional
   inference methods, which cluster GPS points on the basis of their
   spatial distance, are not suited to inferring visit durations. This
   paper presents a pace-based clustering method to infer visit locations
   and durations. The method contributes two novel techniques: (1) It
   clusters GPS points logged during visits by considering the speed and
   applying a probabilistic density function for each trip. Consequently,
   it avoids clustering GPS points that are near but unrelated to visits.
   (2) It also includes additional GPS points in the clusters by
   considering their temporal sequence. As a result, it is able to complete
   the clusters with GPS points that are far from the visits but are logged
   during the visits, caused, for example, by GPS noise indoors. The
   results of an experimental evaluation comparing our proposed method with
   three published inference methods indicate that our proposed method
   infers the duration of a visit with an average error rate of 8.7%,
   notably outperforming the other methods.

AB Many innovative location-based services have been established to offer
   users greater convenience in their everyday lives. These services
   usually cannot map user's physical locations into semantic names
   automatically. The semantic names of locations provide important context
   for mobile recommendations and advertisements. In this article, we
   proposed a novel location naming approach which can automatically
   provide semantic names for users given their locations and time. In
   particular, when a user opens a GPS device and submits a query with her
   physical location and time, she will be returned the most appropriate
   semantic name. In our approach, we drew an analogy between location
   naming and local search, and designed a local search framework to
   propose a spatiotemporal and user preference (STUP) model for location
   naming. STUP combined three components, user preference (UP), spatial
   preference (SP), and temporal preference (TP), by leveraging
   learning-to-rank techniques. We evaluated STUP on 466,190 check-ins of
   5,805 users from Shanghai and 135,052 check-ins of 1,361 users from
   Beijing. The results showed that SP was most effective among three
   components and that UP can provide personalized semantic names, and thus
   it was a necessity for location naming. Although TP was not as
   discriminative as the others, it can still be beneficial when integrated
   with SP and UP. Finally, according to the experimental results, STUP
   outperformed the proposed baselines and returned accurate semantic names
   for 23.6% and 26.6% of the testing queries from Beijing and Shanghai,
   respectively.

AB For most of human history, populations have been relatively isolated
   from each other, and only recently has there been extensive contact
   between peoples, flora and fauna from both old and new worlds. The
   reach, volume and speed of modern travel are unprecedented, with human
   mobility increasing in high income countries by over 1000-fold since
   1800. This growth is putting people at risk from the emergence of new
   strains of familiar diseases, and from completely new diseases, while
   ever more cases of the movement of both disease vectors and the diseases
   they carry are being seen. Pathogens and their vectors can now move
   further, faster and in greater numbers than ever before. Equally
   however, we now have access to the most detailed and comprehensive
   datasets on human mobility and pathogen distributions ever assembled, in
   order to combat these threats. This short review paper provides an
   overview of these datasets, with a particular focus on low income
   regions, and covers briefly approaches used to combine them to help us
   understand and control some of the negative effects of population and
   pathogen movements.

AB The main objective of this work was the development of a new modelling
   tool for quantification of human exposure to traffic-related air
   pollution within distinct microenvironments by using a novel approach
   for trajectory analysis of the individuals. For this purpose, mobile
   phones with Global Positioning System technology have been used to
   collect daily trajectories of the individuals with higher temporal
   resolution and a trajectory data mining, and geo-spatial analysis
   algorithm was developed and implemented within a Geographical
   Information System to obtain time-activity patterns. These data were
   combined with air pollutant concentrations estimated for several
   microenvironments. In addition to outdoor, pollutant concentrations in
   distinct indoor microenvironments are characterised using a
   probabilistic approach. An example of the application for PM2.5 is
   presented and discussed. The results obtained for daily average
   individual exposure correspond to a mean value of 10.6 and 6.0-16.4 mu g
   m(-3) in terms of 5th-95th percentiles. Analysis of the results shows
   that the use of point air quality measurements for exposure assessment
   will not explain the intra- and inter-variability of individuals'
   exposure levels. The methodology developed and implemented in this work
   provides time-sequence of the exposure events thus making possible
   association of the exposure with the individual activities and delivers
   main statistics on individual's air pollution exposure with high
   spatio-temporal resolution.

AB Sensor-enabled smartphones are opening a new frontier in the development
   of mobile sensing applications. The recognition of human activities and
   context from sensor data using classification models underpins these
   emerging applications. However, conventional approaches to training
   classifiers struggle to cope with the diverse user populations routinely
   found in large-scale popular mobile applications. Differences between
   users (e.g., age, sex, behavioral patterns, lifestyle) confuse
   classifiers, which assume everyone is the same. To address this, we
   propose Community Similarity Networks (CSN), which incorporates
   inter-person similarity measurements into the classifier training
   process. Under CSN, every user has a unique classifier that is tuned to
   their own characteristics. CSN exploits crowd-sourced sensor data to
   personalize classifiers with data contributed from other similar users.
   This process is guided by similarity networks that measure different
   dimensions of inter-person similarity. Our experiments show CSN
   outperforms existing approaches to classifier training under the
   presence of population diversity.

AB The location-based social networks have been becoming flourishing in
   recent years. In this paper, we aim to estimate the similarity between
   users according to their physical location histories (represented by GPS
   trajectories). This similarity can be regarded as a potential social tie
   between users, thereby enabling friend and location recommendations.
   Different from previous work using social structures or directly
   matching users' physical locations, this approach model a user's GPS
   trajectories with a semantic location history (SLH), e.g., shopping
   malls -> restaurants -> cinemas. Then, we measure the similarity between
   different users' SLHs by using our maximal travel match (MTM) algorithm.
   The advantage of our approach lies in two aspects. First, SLH carries
   more semantic meanings of a user's interests beyond low-level geographic
   positions. Second, our approach can estimate the similarity between two
   users without overlaps in the geographic spaces, e.g., people living in
   different cities. When matching SLHs, we consider the sequential
   property, the granularity and the popularity of semantic locations. We
   evaluate our method based on a real-world GPS dataset collected by 109
   users in a period of 1 year. The results show that SLH outperforms a
   physicallocation-based approach and MTM is more effective than several
   widely used sequence matching approaches given this application
   scenario.

   The design of the survey was unique in terms of prompted recall surveys
   using GPS with the use of instantaneous data processing, learning
   algorithms to reduce respondent burden, and the inclusion of questions
   relating to activity-planning behavior in a prompted recall survey. In
   the Urban Travel Route and Activity Choice Survey (UTRACS), data was
   collected on long-term activity-travel behavior and planning processes
   for 112 individuals over an average of 10 days. The results of the
   survey show that the planning data obtained from the survey respondents
   appear to be reliable, with minimal fatigue and conditioning effects.
   The documentation of the survey design process, coupled with the
   promising results, show how GPS-based prompted recall surveys using an

AB To realize the full potential of mobile crowd sensing, techniques are
   needed to deal with uncertainty in participant locations and
   trajectories. We propose a novel model for spatial task assignment in
   mobile crowd sensing that uses a dynamic and adaptive data driven scheme
   to assign moving participants with uncertain trajectories to sensing
   tasks, in a near-optimal manner. Our scheme is based on building a
   mobility model from publicly available trajectory history and estimating
   posterior location values using noisy/uncertain measurements upon which
   initial tasking assignments are made. These assignments may be refined
   locally (using exact information) and used by participants to steer
   their future data collection, which completes the feedback loop. We
   present the design of our proposed approach with rationale to suggest
   its value in effective mobile crowd sensing task assignment in the
   presence of uncertain trajectories.

AB GPS-enabled devices have greatly facilitated the continuous collection

   The effective and efficient detection of mobility mode from raw GPS data
   is critically important for social behavior and public health research.
   In this paper, we propose a new method that can be used to automate the
   detection of human mobility mode by synthetically analyzing geographic
   location, duration, speed as well as spatial context information in the
   data. Ancillary GIS layers such as building footprints are also included
   to help identify the GPS points taken indoor. Five mobility modes:
   transporting, parking, walking, roaming and indoor are detected in our
   method. Preliminary testing of the method applied on three datasets
   showed an overall accuracy of above 90% when compared with the human
   interpretation results. A software application has also been developed
   to automate the detection and report generation.

AB Sensing and computational capabilities in smartphones are enabling
   attractive new applications in the area of location aware systems.
   Location aware devices can accurately compute their physical location in
   the form of latitude and longitude. However places contain much more
   valuable information to user rather than coordinates. A place is
   important to a user's personal daily life and carries socially important
   meanings to a user such as a place where one studies, works, eats, lives
   etc. GPS enabled devices like smartphones and tablets use location as a
   context in applications to share their current location. A GPS log of a
   moving object contains time stamped latitude and longitude information.
   The discovery of a user's places is a key challenge and involves mapping
   of GPS data log to meaningful personally important places. In this
   paper, we propose an algorithm that extracts a user's personally
   important places from location traces, and evaluate the algorithm with
   real user's data.

AB Location Based Services (LBS) are evolving very fast but despite this
   are still at an early phase of their evolution. The future LBS services
   will be more anticipatory of users needs and will exploit a broader
   range of information on users. In order to anticipate users' needs, LBS
   providers should be able to understand users' behaviours, preferences
   and interests automatically and without asking the user to specify them.
   Then using the user's current situation and previously extracted
   behaviours, interests and dislikes, the user's needs can be predicted at
   the relevant moment and provide the most appropriate sets of services.
   This paper shows the application of data mining techniques over
   anonymous sets of tracking data to recognise mobility behaviours and
   preferences of users such as Point of Interest (PoI). Tracking data are
   first anonymised then stored in a spatio-temporal database. Then, using
   data mining techniques, rules, models and patterns are recognised. Such
   knowledge, patterns and models are subsequently used for intelligent
   navigation services as input making suggestions.

   Our framework provides a physical activity scale based on typical energy

   estimates the energy expenditure, we use typical value of metabolic
   equivalents to task (MET) which is used as practical scale. Unlike the
   other studies for monitoring physical activity, we estimate the type of
   user's activity using facility information which are obtained from road
   map and land-use/land-cover map. To confirm the feasibility of our
   approach, we have conducted a long-term experiment on monitoring the
   activity of elderly people living in less-populated area. As a result,
   our framework provides good summarization of daily activities of
   participants.

AB With the employment of GPS embedded device, large numbers of data has
   been collected from location aware applications. It is interesting and
   challenging to discover meaningful information behind the data. Since
   the GPS data contains the time information, we take use of the time
   stamps of the GPS data in this paper for better discovering the places
   of interest. The collection usually contains large amounts of
   trajectories, where not every point has information. Therefore, a time
   stamp clustering algorithm is firstly proposed to reduce the size of raw
   data and also extract the points with more information. Different
   clustering algorithms are then conducted on the pre-processed data for
   extracting the places of interest. Finally, we compare the clustering
   algorithms on the GPS data by several external validity indexes.

AB We present a new approach to address the problem of large sequence
   mining from big data. The particular problem of interest is the
   effective mining of long sequences from large-scale location data to be
   practical for Reality Mining applications, which suffer from large
   amounts of noise and lack of ground truth. To address this complex data,
   we propose an unsupervised probabilistic topic model called the distant
   n-gram topic model (DNTM). The DNTM is based on latent Dirichlet
   allocation (LDA), which is extended to integrate sequential information.
   We define the generative process for the model, derive the inference
   procedure, and evaluate our model on both synthetic data and real mobile
   phone data. We consider two different mobile phone datasets containing
   natural human mobility patterns obtained by location sensing, the first
   considering GPS/wi-fi locations and the second considering cell tower
   connections. The DNTM discovers meaningful topics on the synthetic data
   as well as the two mobile phone datasets. Finally, the DNTM is compared
   to LDA by considering log-likelihood performance on unseen data, showing
   the predictive power of the model. The results show that the DNTM
   consistently outperforms LDA as the sequence length increases.

AB In this paper, we aim to mine the interesting locations and the frequent
   travel sequences in a given geo-spatial region. Along this line, a new
   partition method is proposed to divide the trajectories into a set of
   line segments and the geographical-similar endpoints are clustered into
   groups to detect the fixed territories. Also, a path network is
   generated to show the linkage relations between these fixed territories.
   The proposed method can be used to detect frequent movement paths as
   well as fixed territories from GPS trajectories efficiantly.

AB The chapter presents an approach for collecting and identifying the
   daily rounds of agronomists working in the field for a farming products
   company. Besides recognizing their daily movements, the approach enables
   the collection of data about the shape and size of land parcels
   belonging to the company's clients. The work developed involved the
   design of spatial movement patterns for data collection through GPS
   logs, with minimal disruption of the agronomists' activities. The
   extracting of these patterns involved place and activity extraction,
   with specific algorithms proposed for marking and unmarking exploration
   parcels. These algorithms were evaluated by field testing with very
   positive results.
