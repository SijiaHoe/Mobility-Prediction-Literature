AB Despite the importance of predicting evacuation mobility dynamics after
   large scale disasters for effective first response and disaster relief,
   our general understanding of evacuation behavior remains limited because
   of the lack of empirical evidence on the evacuation movement of
   individuals across multiple disaster instances. Here we investigate the
   GPS trajectories of a total of more than 1 million anonymized mobile
   phone users whose positions were tracked for a period of 2 months before
   and after four of the major earthquakes that occurred in Japan. Through
   a cross comparative analysis between the four disaster instances, we
   find that in contrast to the assumed complexity of evacuation decision
   making mechanisms in crisis situations, an individual's evacuation
   probability is strongly dependent on the seismic intensity that they
   experience. In fact, we show that the evacuation probabilities in all
   earthquakes collapse into a similar pattern, with a critical threshold
   at around seismic intensity 5.5. This indicates that despite the
   diversity in the earthquakes profiles and urban characteristics,
   evacuation behavior is similarly dependent on seismic intensity.
   Moreover, we found that probability density functions of the distances
   that individuals evacuate are not dependent on seismic intensities that
   individuals experience. These insights from empirical analysis on
   evacuation from multiple earthquake instances using large scale mobility
   data contributes to a deeper understanding of how people react to
   earthquakes, and can potentially assist decision makers to simulate and
   predict the number of evacuees in urban areas with little computational
   time and cost. This can be achieved by utilizing only the information on
   population density distribution and seismic intensity distribution,
   which can be observed instantaneously after the shock.

AB This study presents a model system for trip destination prediction with
   multi-day GPS data. The pre-trip destination prediction model and the
   during-trip destination prediction model are constructed and calibrated
   for trips on weekdays and weekends, respectively. Combining Markov chain
   and Multinomial logit model, the habit of multi-day destination choice
   is learned and utilized in developing the pre-trip model. By introducing
   support points, the during-trip model is developed with the Hidden
   Markov model. The estimation results indicate that this study improves
   the precision for destination prediction by calibrating the models for
   trips on weekdays and weekends separately and considering habit of
   multi-day destination choice. The findings suggest that travelers
   destination choice behavior follows not only the continuity between
   adjacent destinations, but also the inertia at the same time of day in
   consecutive days, and consecutive weeks as well. The quantitative
   comparison of the habit-based factors indicate that the inertia between
   adjacent destinations has the greatest effect on weekends' destination
   choice, and that in consecutive days has the most significant impact on
   weekdays' destination choice. In addition to real-time travel navigation
   based on the during-trip destination forecasting, the model can be
   applied to Advanced Traveler Information System which provides travelers
   with pre-trip information, such as traffic condition and commercial
   facilities around the destination. Through pre-trip destination
   prediction, study findings can also be utilized in trip distribution
   prediction or crowded location analysis, which presents a wide
   application in transportation planning and management. (C) 2018 Elsevier

AB A mechanistic understanding of human activity patterns lays a foundation
   for many applications. The majority of the current research aims to
   outline human activity patterns mainly from spatiotemporal perspectives
   (i.e., modeling human mobility patterns), lacking of understanding of
   the motivations behind behaviors. The aim of this study is to model and
   understand human activity patterns within urban areas using both
   spatiotemporal and cognitive psychology methods to measure both human
   behavior patterns and the underlying motivations . We first propose a
   framework that enables us to analyze the spatiotemporal patterns of
   urban human activities, infer the associated semantic patterns that
   represent the motivations driving human mobility choices and behaviors,
   and measure the similarity between human activities. We then construct a
   human activity network based on the similarity to depict human activity
   patterns. The framework is applied to a case study of Toronto, Canada,
   where geotagged tweets are used as a proxy for human activities to
   explore activity patterns. The analysis of the human activity network
   shows that 61% of tweeter users follow similar activity patterns. Our
   work provides a new tool for better understanding the way individuals
   interact with urban environments that could be applied\ to a variety of
   urban applications.

AB Nowadays, most people carry around a powerful smartphone which is well
   suited to constantly monitor the location and sometimes even the
   activity of its user. This makes tracking prevalent and leads to a large
   number of projects concerned with trajectory data. One area of
   particular interest is transport and mobility, where data is important
   for urban planning and smart city-related activities, but can also be
   used to provide individual users with feedback and suggestions for
   personal behavior change. As part of a large-scale study based in
   Switzerland, we use activity tracking data to provide people with
   eco-feedback on their own mobility patterns and stimulate them to adopt
   more energy-efficient mobility choices. In this paper we explore the
   opportunities offered by smartphone based activity tracking, propose a
   general framework to exploit location data to foster more sustainable
   mobility behavior, describe the technical solutions chosen and discuss a
   range of outcomes in terms of user perception and sustainability
   potential. The presented approach extracts mobility patterns from users'
   trajectories, computes credible alternative transport options, and
   presents the results in a concise and clear way. The resulting
   eco-feedback helps people to understand their mobility choices, discover
   the most non-ecological parts of their travel behavior, and explore
   feasible alternatives.

AB With the development of GPS and the popularity of mobile devices with
   positioning capability, collecting massive amounts of trajectory data is
   feasible and easy. The daily trajectories of moving objects convey a
   concise overview of their behaviors. Different social roles have
   different trajectory patterns. Therefore, we can identify users or
   groups based on similar trajectory patterns by mining implicit life
   patterns. However, most existing daily trajectories mining studies
   mainly focus on the spatial and temporal analysis of raw trajectory data
   but missing the essential semantic information or behaviors. In this
   paper, we propose a novel trajectory semantics calculation method to
   identify groups that have similar behaviors. In our model, we first
   propose a fast and efficient approach for stay regions extraction from
   daily trajectories, then generate semantic trajectories by enriching the
   stay regions with semantic labels. To measure the similarity between
   semantic trajectories, we design a semantic similarity measure model
   based on spatial and temporal similarity factor. Furthermore, a pruning
   strategy is proposed to lighten tedious calculations and comparisons. We
   have conducted extensive experiments on real trajectory dataset of
   Geolife project, and the experimental results show our proposed method
   is both effective and efficient.

AB Mobile phone data are an interesting new data source for official
   statistics. However, multiple problems and uncertainties need to be
   solved before these data can inform, support or even become an integral
   part of statistical production processes. In this article, we focus on
   arguably the most important problem hindering the application of mobile
   phone data in official statistics: detecting home locations. We argue
   that current efforts to detect home locations suffer from a blind
   deployment of criteria to define a place of residence and from limited
   validation possibilities. We support our argument by analysing the
   performance of five home detection algorithms (HDAs) that have been
   applied to a large, French, Call Detailed Record (CDR) data set (similar
   to 18 million users, five months). Our results show that criteria choice
   in HDAs influences the detection of home locations for up to about 40%
   of users, that HDAs perform poorly when compared with a validation data
   set (resulting in 35 degrees-gap), and that their performance is
   sensitive to the time period and the duration of observation. Based on
   our findings and experiences, we offer several recommendations for
   official statistics. If adopted, our recommendations would help ensure
   more reliable use of mobile phone data vis-a-vis official statistics.

AB During the last decade, network providers are faced by a growing problem
   regarding the distribution of bandwidth and computing resources.
   Recently, the mobile edge computing paradigm was proposed as a possible
   solution, mainly in consideration of the provided possibility of
   transferring service demands at the edge of the network. This solution
   heavily relies on the dynamic allocation of resources, depending on the
   user needs and network connection, therefore it becomes essential to
   correctly predict user movements and activities. This paper proposes an
   unsupervised methodology to define meaningful user locations from
   noninvasive user information, captured by the user terminal with no
   computing or battery overhead. The data is analyzed through a conjoined
   clustering algorithm to build a stochastic Markov chain to predict the
   users' movements and their bandwidth demands. Such a model could be used
   by network operators to optimize network resources allocation. To
   evaluate the proposed methodology, we tested it on one of the largest
   public community's labeled mobile and sensor dataset, developed by the
   "CrowdSignals.io" initiative, and we present positive and promising
   results concerning the prediction capabilities of the model.

AB In this research, we exploit repeated parts in daily trajectories in
   people's movements, which we refer to as mobility patterns, to train
   models to identify and predict a person's lifestyles. We use cellular
   data of a group (society) of people and represent a person's daily
   trajectory using semantic labels (e.g., home, work, and gym) given to
   the main places of interest (POI) he has visited during the day, as
   determined collectively based on interviewing all people of the group.
   First, in an unsupervised manner using a neural network (NN), we embed
   POI-based daily trajectories that always appear together with others in
   consecutive weeks and identify the result of this embedding with social
   lifestyles. Second, using these lifestyles as labels for lifestyle
   prediction, user POI-based daily trajectories are used to train a
   convolutional NN to extract mobility patterns in the trajectories and a
   dynamic NN with flexible memory to assemble these patterns to predict a
   lifestyle for a trajectory never-seen-before. The two-stage algorithm
   shows model accuracy and generalizability in lifestyle identification
   and prediction (both for a novel trajectory and a novel user) that are
   superior to those shown by state-of-the-art algorithms. The code for the
   algorithm and data sets used in our experiments are available online.

AB Location prediction is essential to many commercial applications and
   enables appealing experience for business and governments. Many research
   work show that human mobility is highly predictable. However, existing
   work on location prediction reported limited improvements in using
   generalized spatio-temporal features and unsatisfactory prediction
   accuracy for complex human mobility. To address these challenges, in
   this paper we propose a Mobility Intention and Auto-Completion (MIAC)
   model. We extract those mobility patterns that generalize common
   spatio-temporal features of all users, and use the mobility intentions
   as the hidden states from mobility dataset. A new predicting algorithm
   based on auto-completion is then proposed. The experimental results on
   real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed MIAC model can
   properly capture the regularity of a user's mobility by simultaneously
   considering the spatial and temporal features. The comparison results
   also indicate that MIAC model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
   location prediction methods, and also can predicts long range locations.

AB Object tracking systems play important roles in tracking moving objects
   and overcoming problems such as safety, security and other
   location-related applications. Problems arise from the difficulties in
   creating a well-defined and understandable description of tracking
   systems. Nowadays, describing such processes results in fragmental
   representation that most of the time leads to difficulties creating
   documentation. Additionally, once learned by assigned personnel,
   repeated tasks result in them continuing on autopilot in a way that
   often degrades their effectiveness. This paper proposes the modeling of
   tracking systems in terms of a new diagrammatic methodology to produce
   engineering-like schemata. The resultant diagrams can be used in

AB In this work, we investigate the performance of Markov Chains with
   respect to modelling semantic trajectories and predicting future
   locations. In the first part, we examine whether and to what degree the
   semantic level of semantic trajectories affects the predictive
   performance of a spatial Markov model. It can be shown that the choice
   of the semantic level when describing trajectories has a significant
   impact on the accuracy of the models. High-level descriptions lead to
   better results than low-level ones. The second part introduces a
   multi-dimensional Markov Chain construct that considers, besides
   locations, additional context information, such as time, day and the
   users' activity. While the respective approach is able to outperform our
   baseline, we could also identify some limitations. These are mainly
   attributed to its sensitivity towards small-sized training datasets. We
   attempt to overcome this issue, among others, by adding a semantic
   similarity analysis component to our model that takes the varying role
   of locations due each time to the respective purpose of visiting the
   particular location explicitly into consideration. To capture the
   aforementioned dynamics, we define an entity, which we refer to as
   Purpose-of-Visit-Dependent Frame (PoVDF). In the third part of this
   work, we describe in detail the PoVDF-based approach and we evaluate it
   against the multi-dimensional Markov Chain model as well as with a
   semantic trajectory mining and prefix tree based model. Our evaluation
   shows that the PoVDF-based approach outperforms its competition and lays
   a solid foundation for further investigation.

AB A large plethora of models to predict human mobility exists in the
   literature. The problem of how to select the most appropriate model to
   solve a specific mobility prediction task has however received only
   little attention. Yet, a wrong model choice may lead to severe
   performance losses. In this paper, we address the model selection
   problem in human mobility prediction and make the following
   contributions. We present SELECTOR, a generic framework to explore human
   mobility data and compute both population models and individual models
   to predict human mobility. The former are models that are adapted to the
   characteristics of an entire population of users and can be used to
   overcome the cold-start problem. The latter are prediction models
   optimized for individual users. We present and analyze the results
   obtainable using SELECTOR on the Nokia data set, which is one of the
   largest and richest, publicly available data sets of human mobility
   data. We show that for many users, generic population models can be used
   in place of individual models with negligible performance losses. Yet
   for about 25 percent of the users, individual models perform at least
   three percentage points better than population models. Thereby, we show
   that the use of phone context data does not lead to significantly better
   performance of human mobility predictors with respect to the case in
   which only temporal and spatial features are used. We further observe
   that the population models we derive are robust against the demographics
   of the users and that building different population models for different
   periods of the day leads to performance improvements. We make SELECTOR
   publicly available to allow other researchers and practitioners to
   explore further mobility data sets and to embed the code base of
   SELECTOR in their applications.

AB Use of taxi vehicles as mobile sensors to collect traffic information
   has become an important and emerging approach to relieve congestion.
   Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data allow for abundant
   temporal and spatial information to be collected that reflect the
   mobility and activity of drivers. In this paper, we present a
   probabilistic model to predict driving trip paths based on a Hidden
   Markov Model (HMM). The first step in our approach was to detect the
   stays or destinations by using an improved algorithm based on taxi
   status information about whether or not the vehicle is occupied by
   passengers. Next, the trips between two stays were extracted and
   expressed as data chains for applying the learning scheme in a
   predictive model. A data-driven approach based on an HMM was trained
   with trips from a period of three months and then the model was used to
   predict the future links on which the vehicle may travel. A Linear
   Motion Function (LMF) was then utilized to infer the taxi position on
   the predicted link. Furthermore, a learning algorithm was used to
   identify incorrect links for a given path. Finally, the effectiveness of
   the improved model was tested. In the testing process, samples that
   contained different trips with different taxi statuses (i.e., occupied
   and non-occupied) were considered, and the Relative Accuracy (RA) was
   applied as a measure of effectiveness to evaluate prediction
   performance. The prediction results verified that the proposed method is
   an accurate and feasible potential approach that can be used to estimate
   driving paths in future time periods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Predicting people's next location has attracted the attention of both
   scientists and large Internet companies, for a variety of reasons. The
   analysis of location data collected from smart mobile devices paves the
   way for the improvement of current location based services and the rise
   of new business models, based on rich notifications related to the right
   prediction of users' next location. Moreover, the so-called attention
   technique has been adopted in neural networks learning, aiming at
   considering alignments between different parts of the source training
   data. This article proposes the model Move, Attend and Predict (MAP) to
   predict a person's future location based on his/her mobility pattern
   collected by a mobile device. This is achieved by means of a
   computationally efficient trainable deep neural network model. Our model
   essentially learns which time interval in the trajectory sequences are
   relevant regarding a specific location. In order to extract the
   meaningful representation from trajectories and time sequences, the
   embedding representation learning technique is used. Experimental
   results, obtained from tests conducted on two large real-life datasets,
   demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms
   of precision, recall and F1-score performance metrics. (C) 2018 Elsevier

AB In this paper, we propose a new method to predict the final destination
   of vehicle trips based on their initial partial trajectories. We first
   review how we obtained clustering of trajectories that describes user
   behavior. Then, we explain how we model main traffic flow patterns by a
   mixture of 2-D Gaussian distributions. This yielded a density-based
   clustering of locations, which produces a data driven grid of similar
   points within each pattern. We present how this model can be used to
   predict the final destination of a new trajectory based on their first
   locations using a two-step procedure: we first assign the new trajectory
   to the clusters it most likely belongs. Second, we use characteristics
   from trajectories inside these clusters to predict the final
   destination. Finally, we present experimental results of our methods for
   classification of trajectories and final destination prediction on data
   sets of timestamped GPS-Location of taxi trips. We test our methods on
   two different data sets, to assess the capacity of our method to adapt
   automatically to different subsets.

AB It is becoming increasingly important to accurately detect a user's
   presence at certain locations during certain times of the day, e.g., to
   study the user's patterns with respect to mobility, behavior, or social
   interactions and to enable the delivery of targeted services. However,
   instead of geographic locations, it is often more important to determine
   a locale that is relevant to the user, e.g., the place of work, home,
   homes of family and friends, social gathering places, etc. These
   significant personal places can be determined through analysis, e.g.,
   via segmentation of location traces into a discrete sequence of places.
   However, segmentation of traces with many gaps (e.g., due to loss of
   network connectivity or GPS signal) results in a large number of small
   segments, where many of these segments actually belong together. This
   work proposes a novel segmentation approach that opportunistically fills
   gaps in a user's location trace by borrowing location data from other
   co-located users utilizing the power of mobile crowd sensing and
   computing (MCSC) paradigm. Through our analysis of four separate
   large-scale crowd sensing study datasets, we show that our approach
   yields more and larger segments than the state-of-the-art, where each
   segment accurately represents the presence of a user at a significant
   personal place.

AB Aging population ratios are rising significantly. Health monitoring
   systems (HMS) in smart environments have evolved rapidly to become a
   viable alternative to traditional healthcare solutions. The aim of HMS
   is to not only reduce costs but to also provide timely e-health services
   to individuals wishing to maintain their independence. In this way,
   elderly people can avoid, for as long as possible, any interaction with
   healthcare institutions (e.g. nursing homes and hospitals), which in
   turn reduces pressure on the health system. To fully realise this vision
   of seamless e-health services supporting people in need of them, a
   number of challenges that need further investigation still exist. To
   this end, we provide an overview of the current state of the art for
   smart health monitoring systems. We review HMS in smart environments
   from a general perspective and with a particular focus on systems for
   the elderly and dependent people. We look at the challenges for these
   systems from the perspective of developing the technology itself, system
   requirements, system design and modelling. We present a consolidated
   picture of the most important functions and services offered by HMS for
   monitoring and detecting human behaviour including its concepts,
   approaches, and processing techniques. Moreover, we provide an
   extensive, in-depth analysis and evaluation of the existing research
   findings in the area of e-health systems. Finally, we present challenges
   and open issues facing the smart HMS field and we make recommendations
   on how to improve future systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Location-Based Services (LBSs) provide users especially in smartphones
   with information and services based on their location and interests.
   Predicting people's next location could help in improving the quality of
   such services and, in turn, boosting people's confidence on those
   services. Any successful LBS algorithm or model should target three
   major goals: Location prediction accuracy, high throughput or fast
   response and efficiency in terms of utilizing smartphone resources. This
   paper proposes a new approach to discover and predict people's next
   location based on their mobility patterns, while being computationally
   efficient. The approach starts by discovering Regions-of-Interest (RoIs)
   in people's historical trajectories (which denote the locations where
   users have been previously, frequently). A new model based on Markov
   Chain (MC) is proposed to overcome the drawback of classical MC. Our
   proposed model considers both space and time contexts where the space
   represents a specific location that has been visited by a user while the
   time represents the location visiting time. We show how classical MC
   model can be extended to include movement times and how time will
   improve prediction accuracy. One unique finding in our research is
   related to the value of integrating users' mobility location/space with
   time context. In particular, time context is formulated in a way to add
   extra information to the space context. For better abstraction during
   building the model, a general transformation function is used to
   transform the n-order MC into first order. Results show that the
   proposed approach provides significant improvements in predicting
   people's next location compared with the state-of-the-art models when
   applied on two large real-life datasets, GeoLife and Gowalla. (C) 2018

AB With remarkable advancements in the fields of global satellite based
   navigation systems and wireless communication networks, there is a
   tremendous increase in the number of mobile device users throughout the

   devices are evolving, with a prime motive to deploy wireless multi-hop
   networks into the real world. As these networks are, in general,
   deployed in extreme environmental conditions their performance
   evaluation is a matter of great concern and demands rigorous analysis.
   Several models, simulators, testbeds and visualization tools have
   evolved in the last two decades for analyzing the characteristics of
   these wireless multi-hop networks. In this paper, first we discuss a
   number of models and the changing trends of research along with the
   associated challenges. Then, we discuss several simulators, emulators,
   testbeds and real world projects implementing such networks. Besides, we
   also discuss an important aspect of wireless multi-hop networks, i.e.,
   reliability and identify various imperative metrics from the literature
   for performance evaluation of such dynamic networks.

AB Where GPS technology can precisely register the spatiotemporal elements
   of activity-travel behaviour, travel characteristics need to be imputed
   from the data. As such, throughout the last decade, a plethora of
   methods has been developed to identify trips and activities from raw GPS
   trajectories. However, rule-based methods that use dwell time for the
   classification of activity and trip episodes may disregard short
   activities. In addition, more advanced methods, such as machine learning
   classifiers, are typically used for travel mode recognition. This paper
   therefore aims to systematically compare the relative performance of
   four machine learning algorithms to classify GPS points into activity
   points and travel points. To account for the underlying spatial
   structure of the data, attribute information is supplemented by moving
   multiple spatial windows over preceding and succeeding points to derive
   local densities. Because ground truth is essential to evaluate the
   accuracy of the algorithms, a set of 200 artificial GPS activity-travel
   sequences with varying noise levels was generated to test the
   performance of the algorithms. The results indicate that especially the
   random forest algorithm can lead to high accuracies and that local
   densities are important variables to the accuracy of the classifiers.

AB Nowadays, location-based data collected by GPS-equipped devices such as
   smartphones and cars are often stored as spatio-temporal sequences of
   points denoted as trajectories. The analysis of the large generated
   trajectory databases such as the detection of patterns, outliers, and
   stops has a great importance for many application domains. Over the past
   few years, several successful trajectory data infrastructures have been
   progressively developed for a large range of applications in both the
   terrestrial and maritime environments. However, it still appears that
   amongst many research issues to consider, the resulting uncertainties
   when analyzing local trajectory properties have not been completely
   taken into account. In particular, determining for instance certainty
   rates, while detecting stop points, might have valuable impacts on most
   cases. The framework developed in this paper introduces an approach
   based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, and whose objective is
   to detect trajectory stop points and associated degrees of uncertainty.
   The approach is experimented using a large urban trajectory database and
   is compared to several computational algorithms introduced in previous
   studies. The results show that our approach reduces uncertainty values
   when detecting trajectory stop points as well as a significant
   improvement of the recall and precision values.

AB In recent years, research on location predictions by mining trajectories
   of users has attracted a lot of attentions. Existing studies on this
   topic mostly focus on individual movements, considering the trajectories
   as solo movements. However, a user usually does not visit locations just
   for the personal interest. The preference of a travel group has
   significant impacts on the places they visit. In this paper, we propose
   a novel personalized location prediction approach which further takes
   into account users' travel group type. To achieve this goal, we propose
   a new group pattern discovery approach to extract the travel groups from
   spatial-temporal trajectories of users. Type of the discovered groups,
   then, are identified through utilizing the profile information of the
   group members. The core idea underlying our proposal is the discovery of
   significant movement patterns of users to capture frequent movements by
   considering the group types. Finally, the problem of location prediction
   is formulated as an estimation of the probability of a given user
   visiting a given location based on his/her current movement and his/her
   group type. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on
   location prediction based on trajectory pattern mining that investigates
   the influence of travel group type. By means of a comprehensive
   evaluation using various datasets, we show that our proposed location
   prediction framework achieves significantly higher performance than
   previous location prediction methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Points of interest (POIs) such as stores, gas stations, and parking lots
   are particularly important for maps. Using gas station as a case study,
   this paper proposed a novel approach to enhance POI information using
   low-frequency vehicle trajectory data and social media data. First, the
   proposed method extracted spatial information of the gas station from
   sparse vehicle trace data in two steps. The first step proposed the
   velocity sequence linear clustering algorithm to extract refueling stop
   tracks from the individual trace line after modeling the vehicle
   refueling stop behavior using movement features. The second step used
   the Delaunay triangulation to extract the spatial information of gas
   stations from the collective refueling stop tracks. Second, attribute
   information and dimension sentiment semantic information of the gas
   station were extracted from social media data using the text mining
   method and tripartite graph model. Third, the gas station information
   was enhanced by fusing the extracted spatial data and semantic data
   using a matching method. Experiments were conducted using the 15-day
   vehicle trajectories of 12,000 taxis and social media data from the
   Dazhongdianping in Beijing, China, and the results showed that the
   proposed method could extract the spatial information, attribute
   information, and review information of gas stations simultaneously.
   Compared with ground truth data, the automatically enhanced gas station
   was proved to be of higher quality in terms of the correctness,
   completeness, and real-time.

AB Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) have built bridges between
   virtual space and real-world mobility in recent years. The massive
   check-in data generated in LBSNs makes it possible to predict users'
   future check-in location, which has proved meaningful for e-commerce
   developments. Existing studies mainly focus on predicting the next
   check-in location with a coarse granularity, which only shows limited
   performance in practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a
   comprehensive approach based on user check-in pattern to predict users'
   future check-in location at any fine-grained time in LBSNs. Firstly,
   users' check-in pattern involving time periodicity, global popularity
   and personal preference are analyzed. Secondly, we extract multiple
   features related to user check-in pattern and explore the predictive
   power of each individual feature. Thirdly, a set of features are
   combined into a supervised scoring model and a classification model
   respectively for predicting user's check in location at a fine-grained
   time in the future. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world
   Foursquare datasets are carefully designed to verify the effectiveness
   of the proposed approach. Experimental results show that our approach
   outperforms both baseline methods and state-of-the-art methods on
   various evaluation metrics.

   information is being collected and available. Compared with traditional
   ones (e.g., Amazon, Taobao, and Dangdang), recommender systems built on
   location-based social networks (LB-SNs) have received much attention.
   The former mine users' preferences through the relationship between
   users and items, e.g., online commodity, movies and music. The latter
   add location information as a new dimension to the former, hence
   resulting in a three-dimensional relationship among users, locations,
   and activities. In this article, we summarize LBSN recommender systems
   from the perspective of such a relationship. User, activity, and
   location are called objects, and recommender objectives are formed and
   achieved by mining and using such 3D relationships. From the perspective
   of the 3D relationship among these objects, we summarize the
   state-of-the-art of LBSN recommender systems to fulfill the related
   objectives. We finally indicate some future research directions in this

   provides the probable context-based location of a person and predicts

   to uncertain situations in today's world using different mechanisms such
   as monitoring the human behavior patterns and evaluating the user
   preferences and profiles. A case study of the office activity chart has
   been provided, and based on the experimentation performed on the related
   events, the probability in evaluating some Nchained events of a person
   in a consecutive order using the proposed model has been found to be
   0.002, which infers that there are fewer chances that the person will

AB With the growing interest in studying the characteristics of people's
   access to the food environment and its influence upon individual health,
   there has been a focus on assessing individual food exposure based on
   GPS trajectories. However, existing studies have largely focused on the
   overall activity space using short-period trajectories, which ignores
   the complexity of human movements and the heterogeneity of the spaces
   that are experienced by the individual over daily life schedules. In
   this study, we propose a novel framework to extract the exposure areas
   consisting of the localized activity spaces around daily life centers
   and non-motorized commuting routes from long-term GPS trajectories. The
   newly proposed framework is individual-specific and can incorporate the
   internal heterogeneity of individual activities (spatial extent, stay
   duration, and timing) in different places as well as the dynamics of the
   context. A pilot study of the GeoLife dataset suggests that there are
   significant variations in the magnitude as well as the composition of
   the food environment in different parts of the individual exposure area,
   and residential environment is not representative of the overall
   foodscape exposure.

   is primarily intended for researchers developing approaches for
   personalized mobility analysis, as well as a guideline for practitioners
   to select criteria when assessing and selecting between computational
   approaches. Our main recommendation is to consider user-specific
   accuracy measures in addition to averaged aggregates, as well as to take
   into consideration that for many users accuracy does not saturate fast
   and the performance keeps evolving over time. Therefore, we recommend
   using time-weighted measures. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Human mobility behavior is far from random, and its indicators follow
   non-Gaussian distributions. Predicting human mobility has the potential
   to enhance location-based services, intelligent transportation systems,
   urban computing, and so forth. In this paper, we focus on improving the
   prediction accuracy of non-Gaussian mobility data by constructing a
   hybrid Markov-based model, which takes the non-Gaussian and
   spatio-temporal characteristics of real human mobility data into
   account. More specifically, we (1) estimate the order of the Markov
   chain predictor by adapting it to the length of frequent individual
   mobility patterns, instead of using a fixed order, (2) consider the time
   distribution of mobility patterns occurrences when calculating the
   transition probability for the next location, and (3) employ the
   prediction results of users with similar trajectories if the recent
   context has not been previously seen. We have conducted extensive
   experiments on real human trajectories collected during 21 days from
   3474 individuals in an urban Long Term Evolution (LTE) network, and the
   results demonstrate that the proposed model for non-Gaussian mobility
   data can help predicting people's future movements with more than 56%
   accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One of the initial phases in the applications dealing with data
   processing on GPS trajectory data is to generate the time-stamped
   Sequence of Visited Locations (SVLs) of the mobile objects. The sequence
   is constructed by labeling each of the GPS observations of the
   trajectory using the ID of their intersecting Geometries of Interest
   (GOIs). In this paper, we enhance the performance of the
   state-of-the-art scheme for constructing the GOIs of a mobile object by
   proposing a data aggregation and outlier detection method. Our
   experimental results using geometric similarity metrics show that our
   improved GOI construction method outperforms the baseline methods by
   constructing the GOIs remarkably more geometrically similar to the real
   world GOIs. The geometric similarity metrics are only applicable when we
   have access to the geometries of the real world GOIs (ground truth). To
   be able to analyse the performance of the GOI extraction methods in
   environments which we do not have access to the ground truth, we propose
   two useful spatio-temporal metrics to measure the quality of GOIs based
   on the quality of the generated SVLs based on them. Our experimental
   results show that these two metrics are able to discriminate between the
   results of our different outlier detection methods and select the best
   scheme without using any external knowledge about the geometries of the
   real world GOIs.

   people are able to find some places that attract them from other user's
   travel route. Analysis on the GPS logs can get the point of interest
   that is popular and interesting. By presenting the point of interest,
   user can choose travel place easily and the travel itineraries is

AB With the quick development of mobile Internet and the popularity of
   smartphones, smartphone-based transportation mode detection has become a
   hot topic, which is able to provide effective data support for urban
   planning and traffic management. Though the popular GPS based
   transportation mode detection method has achieved reasonable accuracy,
   this method consumes large power, thus limiting it to be used in
   smartphones. Here, we propose a novel transportation mode detection
   algorithm using the recurrent neural network. In order to identify
   transportation modes with low power consumption, this algorithm only
   uses four low-power-consumption sensors (namely accelerator, gyroscope,
   magnetometer, and barometer) which are embedded in the commodity
   smartphones. Furthermore, we exploited the good representative ability
   of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and applied it to recognizing the
   transportation modes to achieve higher accuracy. To filter noises, a
   preprocessing is applied. After calculating features, we adopt the LSTM
   learning algorithm to train a model of transportation mode recognition
   and employ this model to predict transportation modes. Extensive
   experimental results indicate that our proposed approach outperforms the
   compared state-of-the-art transportation recognition methods with 96.9%
   accuracy to detect four transportation modes, namely buses, cars,
   subways, and trains.

AB Ubiquitous computing is the growing trend of establishing a place for
   technology in the background, rather than the foreground, of our lives
   through embedding computational capability into everyday objects to make
   them effectively communicate and perform useful tasks. Hence, the goal
   of pervasive computing is to make devices "smart". Standing on this
   ground, the model subject of this work enhances the vehicles
   intelligence through enabling them to accurately predict the drivers
   destination without their intervention through an optimized four
   dimensional destination prediction model. Moreover, it takes the lead in
   leveraging the semantic properties of both the locations of interest and
   the social relations affecting the visiting activities of the drivers.
   In line with this, our proposed model simultaneously utilizes an
   optimization algorithm to blend the different dimensions and to
   accommodate the evolving human mobility behavior. The experimental
   results demonstrate that the optimized model significantly outperforms
   the basic model achieving an average prediction accuracy of 95% when
   compared to the real trace. Show the XML Only

   places where stops are made. To detect the hidden knowledge regarding
   these places, this article examines the semantics of massive taxi stops
   in a large city. Each taxi trajectory is modeled as a series of
   sequential semantic stops labeled by street names. All the trajectories
   can be examined as a document corpus, from which the hidden themes of
   the stops are identified through Latent Dirichlet Allocation model.
   Conventional GIS tools are coupled with topic modeling toolkit to

AB Location based services (LBS) bring great convenience to mobile users.
   But, user privacy is threatened since a LBS server knows location
   information of all LBS requester, and it might leak location data in
   order to obtain extra profits. Some cloaked location methods were
   presented to ensure that user location cannot be obtained, but it might
   be inferred indirectly. In this paper, a trajectory analysis method is
   proposed to infer a real trajectory from a cloaked trajectory. First,
   prior knowledge base for geographical situation is constructed. Then, a
   hidden Markov model for trajectory analysis is established and
   trajectory recovery problem is reduced to the optimal state sequence
   prediction problem. Finally, trajectory analysis is fulfilled using the
   dynamic programming algorithm. Experiments show that there are still
   privacy disclosure risks even if a user adopts location cloaking
   approaches. In addition, our method provides a new way to evaluate the
   degree of privacy protection for LBS users. And it provides a reference
   to evaluate of privacy risks and improve privacy level from the view of

   With the advancement of mobile positioning techniques and various
   sensors embedded in smartphones, it is convenient to obtain massive
   human mobile trajectories and to derive a large amount of valuable
   information from geospatial big data. Extracting and recognizing
   personally interesting places and predicting next semantic location
   become a research hot spot in LBS. In this paper, we proposed an
   approach to predict next personally semantic place with historical
   visiting patterns derived from mobile device logs. To address the
   problems of location imprecision and lack of semantic information, a
   modified trip-identify method is employed to extract key visit points
   from GPS trajectories to a more accurate extent while semantic
   information are added through stay point detection and semantic places
   recognition. At last, a decision tree model is adopted to explore the
   spatial, temporal, and sequential features in contextual location
   prediction. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, experiments
   were conducted based on a trajectory collection in Guangzhou downtown
   area. The results verified the feasibility of our approach on contextual

   model could achieve 99.2% accuracy for inferring home and work location.
   Additionally, Spatial Population Census were employed to indirectly
   compare the classification results with ground truth. Furthermore, to

AB The cyber-physical-social (CPS) computing and networking is a human
   centric and holistic computing framework which needs to convert the
   low-level data of physical, cyber, and social worlds into higher level
   information which can provide insights and help humans make complex
   decisions. Here, we focus on human fishing behavior recognition for
   vessel monitoring systems (VMS), an application of CPS. And the
   recognition of fishing behavior is the key task for studying human
   fishing activities, monitoring illegal fishing, and protecting fishery
   resources. However, VMS data basically consist of sequentially recorded
   position information and do not directly indicate whether a fisherman is
   fishing or not; thus, converting these low-level CPS data into intuitive
   information to humans is the primary task. In this paper, an
   identification model based on multi-step clustering algorithm (MSC-FBI)
   is proposed to automatically learn and discover fishingbehaviors at sea.
   First, a temporal-spatial distance model is established; then, an
   improved multi -step clustering algorithm is used to identify human
   fishing behaviors, and finally, the patterns of different behaviors are
   extracted from the trajectory, and the unsupervised behavior learning
   model is established. Using this method, many experiments on different
   fishing trajectory data were implemented and compared with a traditional
   identification method based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM-FBI). The
   experimental results illustrate the proposed model's superior
   performance.

AB Recent progress in Internet of Things (IoT) platforms has allowed us to
   collect large amounts of sensing data. However, there are significant
   challenges in converting this large-scale sensing data into decisions
   for real-world applications. Motivated by applications like health
   monitoring and intervention and home automation we consider a novel
   problem called Activity Prediction, where the goal is to predict future
   activity occurrence times from sensor data. In this paper, we make three
   main contributions. First, we formulate and solve the activity
   prediction problem in the framework of imitation learning and reduce it
   to a simple regression learning problem. This approach allows us to
   leverage powerful regression learners that can reason about the
   relational structure of the problem with negligible computational
   overhead. Second, we present several metrics to evaluate activity
   predictors in the context of real-world applications. Third, we evaluate
   our approach using real sensor data collected from 24 smart home
   testbeds. We also embed the learned predictor into a mobile-device-based
   activity prompter and evaluate the app for nine participants living in
   smart homes. Our results indicate that our activity predictor performs
   better than the baseline methods, and offers a simple approach for
   predicting activities from sensor data.

AB The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is plagued by abnormally high
   no-show and cancellation rates that reduce the productivity and
   efficiency of its medical outpatient clinics. We address this issue by
   developing a dynamic scheduling system that utilizes mobile computing
   via geo-location data to estimate the likelihood of a patient arriving
   on time for a scheduled appointment. These likelihoods are used to
   update the clinic's schedule in real time. When a patient's arrival
   probability falls below a given threshold, the patient's appointment is
   canceled. This appointment is immediately reassigned to another patient
   drawn from a pool of patients who are actively seeking an appointment.
   The replacement patients are prioritized using their arrival
   probability. Real-world data were not available for this study, so
   synthetic patient data were generated to test the feasibility of the
   design. The method for predicting the arrival probability was verified
   on a real set of taxicab data. This study demonstrates that dynamic
   scheduling using geo-location data can reduce the number of unused
   appointments with minimal risk of double booking resulting from
   incorrect predictions. We acknowledge that there could be privacy
   concerns with regards to government possession of one's location and
   offer strategies for alleviating these concerns in our conclusion.

AB The pervasive use of mobile devices and location-based services has
   supported the generation of large spatiotemporal datasets reflecting
   user movement behavior. However, studies on such type of data have
   depended heavily on geographic overlapping, and information about the
   time of day of travel visits has been overlooked. In this paper, we
   proposed an efficient method for mining user movement similarity based
   on users' travel histories as recorded by GPS trajectories. Our approach
   also allowed consideration of related temporal effects. To that end,
   first we introduced a partition method to divide the trajectories into a
   set of line segments that allowed us to explore the correlation between
   users and their visited territories. Significantly, we proposed a
   characteristic point mapping method to transform the sparse GPS
   trajectories into a set of transactional data. Based on this data, we
   conducted a series of data mining procedures for efficient discovery of
   the users' movement information. Second, we proposed a novel, lowrank
   matrix factorization-based method to cluster users' movements into
   groups based on their similarity, including temporal characteristics.
   The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method can be
   used to mine the popular roaming routes of users or similar movements
   efficiently while including temporal patterns. This approach can prove
   valuable for the development of location-based social network
   recommendations and human mobility prediction.

AB The paper proposes a methodology for the identification of workstations
   in earthwork operations based on GPS traces from construction vehicles.
   The model incorporates relevant information extracted from the GPS data
   to infer locations of different workstations as probability
   distributions over the environment. Monitoring of workstation locations
   may support map inference for generating and continuously updating the
   layout and road network topology of the construction environment. A case
   study is conducted at a complex earthwork site in Sweden. The
   workstation identification methodology is used to infer the locations of
   loading stations based on vehicle speeds and interactions between
   vehicles, and the locations of dumping stations based on vehicle turning
   patterns. The results show that the proposed method is able to identify
   workstations in the earthwork environment efficiently and in sufficient
   detail.

AB Social media streams and remote sensing data have emerged as new sources
   for tracking disaster events, and assessing their damages. Previous
   studies focus on a case-by-case approach, where a specific event was
   first chosen and filtering criteria (e.g., keywords, spatiotemporal
   information) are manually designed and used to retrieve relevant data
   for disaster analysis. This paper presents a framework that synthesizes
   multi-sourced data (e.g., social media, remote sensing, Wikipedia, and
   Web), spatial data mining and text mining technologies to build an
   architecturally resilient and elastic solution to support disaster
   analysis of historical and future events. Within the proposed framework,
   Wikipedia is used as a primary source of different historical disaster
   events, which are extracted to build an event database. Such a database
   characterizes the salient spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of
   each type of disaster. Additionally, it can provide basic semantics,
   such as event name (e.g., Hurricane Sandy) and type (e.g., flooding) and
   spatiotemporal scopes, which are then tuned by the proposed procedures
   to extract additional information (e.g., hashtags for searching tweets),
   to query and retrieve relevant social media and remote sensing data for
   a specific disaster. Besides historical event analysis and pattern
   mining, the cloud-based framework can also support real-time event
   tracking and monitoring by providing on-demand and elastic computing
   power and storage capabilities. A prototype is implemented and tested
   with data relative to the 2011 Hurricane Sandy and the 2013 Colorado
   flooding. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
