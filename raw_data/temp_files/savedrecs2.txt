AB Geographic services based on GPS trajectory data, such as location
   prediction and recommender services, have received increasing attention
   because of their potential social and commercial benefits. In this
   study, a Geographic Service Recommender Model (GSRM) is proposed, which
   loosely comprises three essential steps. Firstly, location sequences are
   obtained through a clustering operation on GPS locations. To improve
   efficiency, a programming model with a distributed algorithm is employed
   to accelerate the clustering. Secondly, in order to mine spatial and
   temporal information from the cluster trajectory, an algorithm
   (MiningMP) is designed. Last but not least, the next possible location
   to which the user will travel is predicted. An integrated framework of
   GSRM could then be constructed and provide the appropriate geographic
   recommendation service by considering location sequences as well as
   other related semantic information. Experiments were conducted based on
   real GPS trajectories from Microsoft Research Asia (182 users within a
   period of five years). The experimental results clearly demonstrate that
   our proposed GSRM model is effective and efficient at predicting
   locations and can provide users with personalized smart recommendation
   services in the following possible position with excellent performance
   in scalability, adaptability, and quality of service.

AB In recent years, sensors of mobile devices are increasingly used in the
   research field of Active and Assisted Living (AAL), in particular, for
   movement analysis. Questions, such as where users typically stay (and
   for how long), where they have been or where they will most likely be
   going to, are of utmost importance for implementing smart AAL services.
   Due to the plethora of application scenarios and varying requirements,
   the challenge is the identification of an appropriate stay detection
   approach. Thus, this paper presents a comprehensive framework covering
   the entire process from data acquisition, pre-processing,
   parameterization to evaluation so that it can be applied to evaluate
   various stay detection methods. Additionally, ground truth data as well
   as application field data are used within the framework. The framework
   has been validated with three different spatio-temporal clustering
   approaches (time-based/incremental clustering, extended density based
   clustering, and a mixed method approach). Using the framework with
   ground truth data and data from the AAL field, it can be concluded that
   the time-based/incremental clustering approach is most suitable for this
   type of AAL applications. Furthermore, using two different datasets has
   proven successful as it provides additional data for selecting the
   appropriate method. Finally, the way the framework is designed it might
   be applied to other domains such as transportation, mobility, or tourism
   by adapting the pre-selection criteria.

   rapidly for context-aware applications. This paper proposes a deep
   learning mechanism to identify the transportation modes of smartphone
   users. The proposed mechanism is evaluated on a database that contains
   more than 1000 h of accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope
   measurements from five transportation modes, including still, walk, run,
   bike, and vehicle. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the
   proposed mechanism, which achieves approximately 95% classification
   accuracy and outperforms four well-known machine learning methods.
   Meanwhile, we investigated the model size and execution time of

AB Location uncertainty has been a major barrier in information mining from
   location data. Although the development of electronic and
   telecommunication equipment has led to an increased amount and refined
   resolution of data about individuals' spatio-temporal trajectories, the
   potential of such data, especially in the context of environmental
   health studies, has not been fully realized due to the lack of
   methodology that addresses location uncertainties. This article
   describes a methodological framework for deriving information about
   people's continuous activities from individual-collected Global
   Positioning System (GPS) data, which is vital for a variety of
   environmental health studies. This framework is composed of two major
   methods that address critical issues at different stages of GPS data
   processing: (1) a fuzzy classification method for distinguishing
   activity patterns; and (2) a scale-adaptive method for refining activity
   locations and outdoor/indoor environments. Evaluation of this framework
   based on smartphone-collected GPS data indicates that it is robust to
   location errors and is able to generate useful information about
   individuals' life trajectories.

   relevant information about users and understanding their mobile behavior
   and preferences based on the location histories. The increasing
   availability of large amounts of spatio-temporal data brings us
   opportunities and challenges to automatically discover valuable
   knowledge. While context-aware properties quickly became the key of the
   success of these pervasive applications, information related to user
   preferences and social signals still lack of adequate capitalization.
   Local search in LBSs is a peculiar service where recent and current
   interests, the network of explicit and implicit social interactions
   between users can be combined for effectively performing fine-tuned and
   personalized recommendations of points of interest. In this article we

AB By utilizing today's web-based technologies, people can act as sensors
   and share their perceptions, emotions and observations in a variety of
   data forms, such as images, videos, texts, Global Positioning System
   (GPS) trajectories and maps. These forms are collectively called
   user-generated content (UGC). These data are in different domains and
   have a multi-modality nature. Although recent efforts have probed the
   acquisition of local knowledge by using single-domain UGC data in
   specific applications, such efforts have not thus far presented a model
   considering multi-domain UGC specifically to enrich road network data.
   This article aims at presenting such a model wherein, with the help of
   each data domain of UGC, one aspect of people knowledge about the road
   segment is obtained. These different aspects of knowledge are integrated
   using a Skyline operator to support multi-criteria route finding. We
   name this model ERSBU (enriching road segments based on UGC). In ERSBU,
   road segments are basic spatial units, and their subjective properties
   have been extracted by using available UGC. The scenic score for each
   road segment was computed by using geo-tagged Panoramio photos. The
   accessibility level of each road segment to different facilities was
   calculated based on data captured from Wikimapia and OpenStreetMap.
   Moreover, for measuring the movement popularity of each road segment,
   Wikiloc and Everytrail GPS trajectories were utilized. For the
   implementation of the ERSBU model, Tehran region 6 was considered the
   case study area. The Evaluation of the results proved that road segments
   that achieved a high score based on knowledge extracted from UGC also
   mostly gained top scores by analyzing traditional maps. ERSBU allows
   users to accomplish more-qualitative path finding by considering the
   multi-view characteristics of road segments.

AB Nowadays large amounts of GPS trajectory data is continuously collected
   by GPS-enabled devices such as vehicles navigation systems and mobile
   phones. GPS trajectory data is useful for applications such as traffic
   management, location forecasting, and itinerary planning. Such
   applications often need to extract the time-stamped sequence of visited
   locations (SVLs) of the mobile objects. The nearest neighbor query (NNQ)
   is the most applied method for labeling the visited locations based on
   the IDs of the points of interests (POIs) in the process of SVL
   generation. NNQ in some scenarios is not accurate enough. To improve the
   quality of the extracted SVLs, instead of using NNQ, we label the
   visited locations as the IDs of the POIs which geometrically intersect
   with the GPS observations. Intersection operator requires the accurate
   geometries of the POIs which we refer to them as the geometries of
   interest (GOIs). In some application domains (e.g. movement trajectories
   of animals), adequate information about the POIs and their geometries
   may not be available a priori, or they may not be publicly accessible
   and, therefore, they need to be derived from GPS trajectory data. In
   this paper we propose a novel method for estimating the GOIs, which
   consists of three phases: (1) extracting the geometries of the stay
   regions; (2) constructing the geometry of destination regions based on
   the extracted stay regions; and (3) constructing the GOIs based on the
   geometries of the destination regions. Using the geometric similarity to
   known GOIs as the major evaluation criterion, the experiments we
   performed using long-term GPS trajectory data show that our method
   outperforms the state-of-the-art.

AB With the emergence of smartphones and location-based services, user
   mobility prediction has become a critical enabler for a wide range of
   applications, like location-based advertising, early warning systems,
   and citywide traffic planning. A number of techniques have been proposed
   to either conduct spatio-temporal mobility prediction or forecast the
   next-place. However, both produce diverse prediction performance for
   different users and display poor performance for some users. This paper
   focuses on investigating the effect of living habits on the models of
   spatio-temporal prediction and next-place prediction, and selects one
   from these two models for an individual to achieve effective mobility
   prediction at users' points of interest. Based on the hidden Markov
   model (HMM), a spatio-temporal predictor and a next-place predictor are
   proposed. Living habits are analyzed in terms of entropy, upon which
   users are clustered into distinct groups. With large-scale factual
   mobile data captured from a big city, we compare the proposed HMM-based
   predictors with existing state-of-the-art predictors and apply them to
   different user groups. The results demonstrate the robust performance of
   the two proposed mobility predictors, which outperform the state of the
   art for various user groups.

AB Collecting annotated activity data is vital to many forms of
   context-aware system development. Leveraging a crowd of smartphone users
   to collect annotated activity data in the wild is a promising direction
   because the data being collected are realistic and diverse. However,
   current research lacks a systematic analysis comparing different
   approaches for collecting such data and investigating how users use
   these approaches to collect activity data in real world settings. In
   this paper, we report results from a field study investigating the use
   of mobile crowdsourcing to collect annotated travel activity data
   through three approaches: Participatory, Context Triggered In Situ, and
   Context-Triggered Post Hoc. In particular, we conducted two phases of
   analysis. In Phase One, we analyzed and compared the resulting data
   collected via the three approaches and user experience. In Phase Two, we
   analyzed users' recording and annotation behavior as well as the
   annotation content in using each approach in the field. Our results
   suggested that although Context-Triggered approaches produced a larger
   number of recordings, they did not necessarily lead to a larger quantity
   of data than the Participatory approach. It was because many of the
   recordings were either not labeled, incomplete, and/or fragmented due to
   the imperfect context detection. In addition, recordings collected by
   the Participatory approach tended to be more complete and contain less
   noise. In terms of user experience, while users appreciated automated
   recording and reminders because of their convenience, they highly valued
   having the control over what and when to record and annotate that the
   Participatory approach provided. Finally, we showed that activity type
   (Driver, Riding as Passenger, Walking) influenced users' behaviors in
   recording and annotating their activity data. It influenced the timing
   of recording and annotating using the Participatory approach, users'
   receptivity using the Context-Triggered In Situ approach, and the
   characteristics of the content of annotations. Based on these findings,
   we provide design and methodological recommendations for future work
   that aims to leverage mobile crowdsourcing to collect annotated activity
   data.

AB With the increasing use of mobile GPS (global positioning system)
   devices, a large volume of trajectory data on users can be produced. In
   most existing work, trajectories are usually divided into a set of stops
   and moves. In trajectories, stops represent the most important and
   meaningful part of the trajectory; there are many data mining methods to
   extract these locations. DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of
   applications with noise) is a classical density-based algorithm used to
   find the high-density areas in space, and different derivative methods
   of this algorithm have been proposed to find the stops in trajectories.
   However, most of these methods required a manually-set threshold, such
   as the speed threshold, for each feature variable. In our research, we
   first defined our new concept of move ability. Second, by introducing
   the theory of data fields and by taking our new concept of move ability
   into consideration, we constructed a new, comprehensive, hybrid
   feature-based, density measurement method which considers temporal and
   spatial properties. Finally, an improved DBSCAN algorithm was proposed
   using our new density measurement method. In the Experimental Section,
   the effectiveness and efficiency of our method is validated against real
   datasets. When comparing our algorithm with the classical density-based
   clustering algorithms, our experimental results show the efficiency of
   the proposed method.

   extract the human mobility patterns from GPS traces in order to derive
   an indicator for enhancing Collaborative Mobility (CM) between
   individuals. The first step, extracting activity duration and location,
   is done using state-of-the-art automated recognition tools. Sensors data
   are used to reconstruct individual's activity location and duration

   defined different variables and methods for specific case studies.
   Smartphone sensor data are being collected from a limited number of
   individuals and for one week. These data are used to evaluate the
   proposed indicator. Based on the value of the indicator, we analyzed the
   potential for identifying CM among groups of users, such as sharing
   traveling resources (e.g., carpooling, ridesharing, parking sharing) and
   time (rescheduling and reordering activities).

AB As mobile crowd sensing (MCS) cannot provide reliable services, the
   quality of service (QoS) is a major research interest. Since the service
   node makes a decisive impact on two vital factors of QoS, service node
   selection is becoming a novel research direction in MCS. In this paper,
   we analyze the factors that need attention when selecting proper service
   nodes in MCS and define the service node selection problem (SNSP) as
   follows: finding the optimal set of service nodes, provided that
   optimizes multiple metrics of QoS simultaneously and satisfies the
   network resource constraint. Accordingly, we formulate a multiobjective
   optimization model (MOOM), which converts SNSP to a multiobjective
   optimization problem (MOOP). Since the MOOM considers the comprehensive
   effect of all service nodes on one metric as one objective of MOOP, it
   can handle the diversity of metrics and conflicts between them; in
   particular, it can flexibly change the metric system of QoS depending on
   different demands. To demonstrate the value and effectiveness of the
   proposed MOOM, we propose a paradigm of it and design a corresponding
   multiobjective optimization selection mechanism. This paradigm focuses
   on the influence of node spatiotemporal mobility on both data collection
   and data transmission. Extensive experiments and comparison on a
   real-world data show that MOOM is an effective model for selecting
   service nodes with both good coverage and transmission performances.

   geolocation prediction. Because of the diversity of geolocation data,
   geolocation prediction can be divided into two primary parts: the mining
   popular geolocation region (MPGR), which is the first step in
   preprocessing geolocation data when building a geolocation prediction
   model (GPM); and mining personal trajectory (MPT), which is the second
   step in building a geolocation prediction model. This article aims to
   survey existing solutions for geolocation prediction in the era of
   mobility big data. It first introduces the concepts, classifications,
   and characteristics of geolocation prediction. Then it describes the
   basic principles and characteristics of mining popular geolocation
   regions and mining personal trajectory. This article also discusses
   challenges, opportunities, and future directions of mobility data
   analytics for geolocation prediction.

AB Micro-blogging services can track users' geo-locations when users
   check-in their places or use geo-tagging which implicitly reveals
   locations. This "geo tracking" can help to find topics triggered by
   certain events in certain regions. However, discovering such topics is
   very challenging because of the large amount of noisy messages (e.g.
   daily conversations). This paper proposes a method to model geographical
   topics, which can filter out irrelevant words by different weights in
   the local and global contexts. Our method is based on the Latent
   Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model but each word is generated from either
   a local or a global topic distribution by its generation probabilities.
   We evaluated our model with data collected from Weibo, which is
   currently the most popular micro-blogging service for Chinese. The
   evaluation results demonstrate that our method outperforms other
   baseline methods in several metrics such as model perplexity, two kinds
   of entropies and KL-divergence of discovered topics.

AB In recent years, with the advances in mobile communication and growing
   popularity of the fourth-generation mobile network along with the
   enhancement in location positioning techniques, mobile devices have
   generated extensive spatial trajectory data, which represent the
   mobility of moving objects. New services are emerged to serve mobile
   users based on their predicted locations. Most of the existing studies
   on location prediction were focused on predicting the next location of a
   user, which is regarded as short-term next location prediction. While
   more advanced location-based services could be enabled for the users if
   long-term location prediction could be achieved, the existing methods
   constrained in next-location prediction are not applicable for long-term
   prediction scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel prediction
   framework named LSTM-PPM that utilises deep learning and periodic
   pattern mining for long-term prediction of user locations. Our framework
   devises the ideology from natural language model and uses multi-step
   recursive strategy to perform long-term prediction. Furthermore, the
   periodic pattern mining technique is utilized to reduce the accumulated
   loss in the multi-step strategy. Through empirical evaluation on a
   real-life trajectory dataset, our proposed approach is shown to provide
   effective performance in long-term location prediction. To the best of
   our knowledge, this is the first work addressing the research topic on
   long-term user location prediction.

   knowledge of possible destinations. In contrast to most work in this
   field, it does so without the need for prior analysis of habitual travel
   patterns. The method models the certainty of each POI by means of a
   virtual charge, resulting in an artificial potential field that reflects
   the current estimate of the subject's intentions. The virtual charges
   are updated as new information about the subject's position arrives. We
   experimentally compare a number of update rules with various parameter
   settings, showing that it is important to take the distance to a
   potential destination into account when updating the charge.

   This article proposes a novel destination prediction approach
   Destination Prediction specially for the check-in service of geo-social
   networks, which not only addresses the "data sparsity problem'' faced by
   common destination prediction approaches, but also takes advantages of
   the commonly available background information from geo-social networks
   and other public resources, such as social structure, road network, and
   speed limits. Further considering the Destination Prediction-based
   attack model, we present a location privacy protection method Check-in
   Deletion and framework Destination Prediction + Check-in Deletion to
   help check-in users detect potential location privacy leakage and retain
   confidential locational information against destination inference
   attacks without sacrificing the real-time check-in precision and user
   experience. A new data preprocessing method is designed to construct a
   reasonable complete check-in subset from the worldwide check-in data set
   of a real-world geo-social network without loss of generality and
   validity of the evaluation. Experimental results show the great
   prediction ability of Destination Prediction approach, the effective
   protection capability of Check-in Deletion method against destination
   inference attacks, and high running efficiency of the Destination
   Prediction + Check-in Deletion framework.

AB Location prediction is essential to many proactive applications and many
   research works show that human mobility is highly predictable. However,
   existing works are reported with limited improvements in using
   generalized spatio-temporal features and unsatisfactory accuracy in
   complex human mobility. To address these challenges, a Mobility
   Intention and Auto-Completion (MIAC) model is proposed. We extract
   mobility patterns to capture common spatio-temporal features of all
   users, and use mobility intentions to characterize these mobility
   patterns. A new predicting algorithm based on auto-completion is then
   proposed. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate
   that the proposed MIAC model can properly capture the regularity in
   human mobility by simultaneously considering spatial and temporal
   features. The comparison results also indicate that MIAC model
   significantly outperforms state-of-the-art location prediction methods,
   and can also predict long range locations.

AB Human mobility modelling has emerged as an important research area over
   the past years. The opportunities that mobility modelling offers are
   widespread. From smart transportation services to reliable
   recommendations systems, all require generation of mobility models.
   Since mobility of humans is generally motivated by the activities they
   perform, activity recognition emerges as a vital initial step towards
   building better and accurate mobility models. The activity recognition
   can be carried out by analyzing relevant data from GPS devices,
   accelerometers and many other sensing sources. The most common approach
   is to combine data from different sources, analyze that data and
   recognize the type of activity being performed. However, this requires
   access to many specialized devices and customized infrastructures. As an
   alternate, this paper introduces a novel approach to recognize
   activities from the GPS traces only. This approach utilizes
   Adaptive-Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) which combines the power
   of neural networks and fuzzy logic to recognize activities. The approach
   is tested on three different datasets and shows promising results. In
   addition to this a multi-cloud architecture is proposed, for the
   deployment of such a system.

   play a more important role in people's daily life. The user's location
   and its semantic are very important to Location Based Services (LBS),
   and this inspires a tremendous amount of research effort on analyzing
   large-scale trajectory data to mine these informations in the last
   decade. The existing researches have achieved good results, but there
   are still some challenges, such as the limitation on low quality data.
   In this paper, firstly, we propose a novel algorithm to mine meaningful
   points on cellular network data, which can reduce the processing time
   apparently by conditional filtering original data. Then, we adopt a
   density based clustering method together with a naive Bayes classifier
   to complete the important location discovery and semantic analysis.
   Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on real dataset show
   that: 1) The precision rate and recall rate of identifying important
   locations have reached more than 96%, which are improved by nearly 3%
   comparing with the existing algorithms. Meanwhile, the precision rate
   and recall rate of semantic analysis are also increased by more than 4%.
   2) When applying to low quality data, the proposed approach is also
   robust, efficient and has a good performance.

AB Made possible by the availability of spatio-temporal data collected by
   smart phones and other smart devices, understanding people's mobility
   patterns has become one of the most promising location based services in
   the past few years, providing various businesswise application
   possibilities. The simplest version of possibilities is to predict where
   a user will go next. In this paper, we present a novel approach that
   goes beyond predicting users' next location and is able to predict their
   entire mobility patterns. Building on previous work, our models are
   based on statistical Markov state-space models. In our approach,
   however, we add temporal information ("arrival profiles" and
   "probability of stay" profiles) explicitly to the models. Using Monte
   Carlo simulations on these models enables us to predict multiple future
   locations, including residence times. We evaluate the models on
   real-world data sets (1.5 year personally collected mobile phone raw GPS
   logs and a publicly available Nokia Mobile Data Challenge data set)
   using different evaluation metrics. An extensive evaluation shows that
   our proposed methods have better predictive power (higher recall) than
   standard state-space models.

AB Location-based social networks are becoming a unique platform for
   understanding user behaviors and providing pervasive services in

   Twitter accounts, we tested different user features with the goal of
   classifying fake users. Experiments demonstrate an accuracy over 95% in

TI A Hybrid Model Towards Moving Route Prediction Under Data Sparsity

AB Moving route prediction offers important benefits for many emerging
   location-aware applications such as target advertising and urban traffic
   management. A common approach to route prediction is to match similar
   trace recordings from a larger volume of historical trajectories, and
   return the targeted recorded path as desired answer. However, due to
   privacy concerns, incentive mechanism and other reasons, especially in
   small business environment, a limited dataset with sparse trajectories
   is only available. Actually, the existing sparse dataset cannot cover
   sufficient query routes, and then the match-based approach may return no
   results at all. Moreover, the existing sparse dataset may fail many
   trajectory mining approaches that work well on general environment. In
   this paper, we investigate moving route prediction from sparse
   trajectory dataset, and propose a novel hybrid model, namely HMRP, to
   address the above problem. To avoid sparse distribution over spatial
   semantic layer, a road network map reconstruction methods are proposed
   to accommodate the sparse trajectories in semantic transformation. And
   then, by training historical trajectories, the implicit mobility
   patterns and Markov transition model are constructed to support route
   prediction. When a query trajectory arrives, towards its derived
   potential destination, our proposed HMRP model integrates pattern
   matching strategy and Markov probability distribution to predict its
   future route gradually in a complementary way. Experiments on real-life
   taxicab GPS recorded dataset demonstrate that HMRP method can improve
   movement prediction precision significantly, comparing with the baseline
   prediction algorithms. And the response time for each query trajectory
   is acceptable for most application cases.

AB The use of mobile devices and GPS technology allow the implementation of
   systems to analyze the context and typical transport activities of a
   user, through the analysis of the location data and acceleration
   sensors. This research includes the processing of data obtained via GPS.
   This processing is intended to detect the mode of transport of a user in
   segments of predefined paths. For classification, velocity profiles that
   identify modes of transport in each segment are used. The software
   implements a Java programming language and the use of Matlab for
   analysis and data filters. The software system is developed into two
   components; the first comprises the filter and transformation of data.
   These data are plotted from decimal coordinates to cartesian
   coordinates. The second presents the classification for the detection of
   transport modes with cartesian coordinates. It also contains the
   analysis of states of kinematic movements. The tests are performed
   through a dataset taken from the GeoLife project of Microsoft Asia. The
   obtained results show a coherent detection on the means of transport
   that the different users use. These users are compared from predefined
   speed profiles.

   technologies like global positioning system (GPS) has enabled the
   convenient logging of the movement sequences of users using mobile
   devices. This work proposes a personalised tourist spot recommender
   system for mobile users using genetic algorithm (GA) for a situation
   when explicit user ratings for tourist spots are not available. Implicit
   ratings of users for tourist spots are mined using GPS trajectory logs.
   GA is used to evolve ratings of unvisited spots using implicit ratings.
   GPS trajectory dataset of 178 users collected by Microsoft Research
   Asia's GeoLife project is used for the purpose of evaluation and
   experiments. We emphasise that proposed approach is comparable with
   existing related approaches when compared in terms of average root mean
   squared error (RMSE) and provides focused, personalised and relevant

   sensor devices. An overall description, including design architecture
   and system modules, is presented. The primary issues are devoted to
   satisfying the requirements of key group identification and surveillance
   under normal and emergency circumstance. For the sake of panoramic
   understanding of human distribution and movement, semantic trajectory
   information is extracted from dynamic transportation data and static
   human distribution data. The sequential Monte Carlo method in
   conjunction with a state-transition model is employed to predict the
   updating real-time locations. The proposed algorithm selects particles
   from time-stamped sequential historical data sets. Simultaneously, a
   resampling strategy is developed to replace low-weight particles. A
   curve similarity measurement called Frechet distance is employed to
   compare trajectories and city roads. Afterward, human daily location and
   significant locations are identified based on the clustering method. To
   evaluate the proposed procedure and methods, sequential trajectory data
   sets come from the GeoLife project along with human distribution logs
   from smartphone application EMAPP are utilized. Finally, we demonstrate
   the potential of dealing location information for promoting emergency

AB Social media applications are widely deployed in mobile platforms
   equipped with built-in GPS tracking devices, and these devices have led
   to an unprecedented collection of geolocated data (geo-tags). Geo-tags,
   along with place names, offer new opportunities to explore the
   trajectory and mobility patterns of social media users. However,
   trajectory data captured by social media are sparsely and irregularly
   spaced and therefore have varying degrees of resolution in both space
   and time. Previous studies on next location prediction are mostly
   applicable for detecting the upcoming location of a moving object using
   dense GPS trajectories where locations are recorded at regular time
   intervals (e.g., 1 minute). Additionally, point features are commonly
   used to represent the locations of visits, but using point features
   cannot capture the variability of human mobility. This article
   introduces a new methodology to predict an individual's next location
   based on sparse footprints accumulated over a long time period using
   social networks, and uses polygons to represent the location
   corresponding to the physical activity area of individuals. First, the
   density-based spatial clustering algorithm is employed to discover the
   most representative activity zones that an individual frequently visits
   on a daily basis, and a polygon-based region is then derived for each
   representative activity zone. A sparse mobility Markov chain model
   considering both the movements and online behaviors of the social media
   user is trained and used to predict the user's next location. Initial
   experiments with a group of Washington DC Twitter users demonstrate that
   the proposed methodology successfully discovers the activity regions and
   predicts the user's next location with accuracy approaching 78.94%.

AB Smartphones have emerged as a promising type of equipment for monitoring
   human activities in environmental health studies. However, degraded
   location accuracy and inconsistency of smartphone-measured GPS data have
   limited its effectiveness for classifying human activity patterns. This
   study proposes a fuzzy classification scheme for differentiating human
   activity patterns from smartphone-collected GPS data. Specifically, a
   fuzzy logic reasoning was adopted to overcome the influence of location
   uncertainty by estimating the probability of different activity types
   for single GPS points. Based on that approach, a segment aggregation
   method was developed to infer activity patterns, while adjusting for
   uncertainties of point attributes. Validations of the proposed methods
   were carried out based on a convenient sample of three subjects with
   different types of smartphones. The results indicate desirable accuracy
   (e.g. up to 96% in activity identification) using of this method. Two
   examples are provided in the Appendix to illustrate how the proposed
   methods could be applied in environmental health studies. Researchers
   could tailor this scheme to fit a variety of research topics.

AB The availability of massive digital traces of individuals is offering a
   series of novel insights on the understanding of patterns characterizing
   human mobility. Many studies try to semantically enrich mobility data
   with annotations about human activities. However, these approaches
   either focus on places with high frequencies (e.g., home and work), or
   relay on background knowledge (e.g., public available points of
   interest). In this paper, we depart from the concept of frequency and we
   focus on a high level representation of mobility using network
   analytics. The visits of each driver to each systematic destination are
   modeled as links in a bipartite network where a set of nodes represents
   drivers and the other set represents places. We extract such network
   from two real datasets of human mobility based, respectively, on GPS and
   GSM data. We introduce the concept of mobility complexity of drivers and
   places as a ranking analysis over the nodes of these networks. In
   addition, by means of community discovery analysis, we differentiate
   subgroups of drivers and places according both to their homogeneity and
   to their mobility complexity.

AB Understanding human activity patterns plays a key role in various
   applications in an urban environment, such as transportation planning
   and traffic forecasting, urban planning, public health and safety, and
   emergency response. Most existing studies in modeling human activity
   patterns mainly focus on spatio-temporal dimensions, which lacks
   consideration of underlying semantic context. In fact, what people do
   and discuss at some places, inferring what is happening at the places,
   cannot be simple neglected because it is the root of human mobility
   patterns. We believe that the geo-tagged semantic context, representing
   what individuals do and discuss at a place and a specific time, drives a
   formation of specific human activity pattern. In this paper, we aim to
   model human activity patterns not only based on space and time but also
   with consideration of associated semantics, and attempt to prove a
   hypothesis that similar mobility patterns may have different
   motivations. We develop a spatiotemporal-semantic model to
   quantitatively express human activity patterns based on topic models,
   leading to an analysis of space, time and semantics. A case study is
   conducted using Twitter data in Toronto based on our model. Through
   computing the similarities between users in terms of spatiotemporal
   pattern, semantic pattern and spatiotemporal-semantic pattern, we find
   that only a small number of users (2.72%) have very similar activity
   patterns, while the majority (87.14%) show different activity patterns
   (i.e., similar spatiotemporal patterns and different semantic patterns,
   similar semantic patterns and different spatiotemporal patterns, or
   different in both). The population of users that has very similar
   activity patterns is decreased by 56.41% after incorporating semantic
   information in the corresponding spatiotemporal patterns, which can
   quantitatively prove the hypothesis. (C) 2016 International Society for

AB Understanding travel behavior is critical for an effective urban
   planning as well as for enabling various context-aware service
   provisions to support mobility as a service (MaaS). Both applications
   rely on the sensor traces generated by travellers' smartphones. These
   traces can be used to interpret travel modes, both for generating
   automated travel diaries as well as for real-time travel mode detection.
   Current approaches segment a trajectory by certain criteria, e.g., drop
   in speed. However, these criteria are heuristic, and, thus, existing
   approaches are subjective and involve significant vagueness and
   uncertainty in activity transitions in space and time. Also,
   segmentation approaches are not suited for real time interpretation of
   open-ended segments, and cannot cope with the frequent gaps in the
   location traces. In order to address all these challenges a novel, state
   based bottom-up approach is proposed. This approach assumes a fixed
   atomic segment of a homogeneous state, instead of an event-based
   segment, and a progressive iteration until a new state is found. The
   research investigates how an atomic state-based approach can be
   developed in such a way that can work in real time, near-real time and
   offline mode and in different environmental conditions with their
   varying quality of sensor traces. The results show the proposed
   bottom-up model outperforms the existing event-based segmentation models
   in terms of adaptivity, flexibility, accuracy and richness in
   information delivery pertinent to automated travel behavior
   interpretation.

AB High-accuracy location identification is the basis of location awareness
   and location services. However, because of the influence of GPS signal
   loss, data drift and repeated access in the individual trajectory data,
   the efficiency and accuracy of existing algorithms have some
   deficiencies. Therefore, we propose a two-step clustering approach to
   extract individuals' locations according to their GPS trajectory data.
   Firstly, we defined three different types of stop points; secondly, we
   extracted these points from the trajectory data by using the
   spatio-temporal clustering algorithm based on time and distance. The
   experimental results show that the spatio-temporal clustering algorithm
   outperformed traditional extraction algorithms. It can avoid the
   problems caused by repeated access and can substantially reduce the
   effects of GPS signal loss and data drift. Finally, an improved
   clustering algorithm based on a fast search and identification of
   density peaks was applied to discover the trajectory locations. Compared
   to the existing algorithms, our method shows better performance and
   accuracy.

AB Destination prediction is very important in location-based services such
   as recommendation of targeted advertising location. Most current
   approaches always predict destination according to existing trip based
   on history trajectories. However, no existing work has considered the
   difference between the effects of passing-by locations and the
   destination in history trajectories, which seriously impacts the
   accuracy of predicted results as the destination can indicate the
   purpose of traveling. Meanwhile, the temporal information of history
   trajectories in destination prediction plays an important role. On one
   hand, the history trajectories in different periods also differ in the
   influence, e.g., the history trajectories from last week can reflect the
   status quo more accurately than the history trajectories two years ago.
   On the other hand, the history trajectories in different time slots
   reflect different facts of traffic and moving habits of people, e.g.,
   visiting a restaurant in the daytime and visiting a bar at night.
   Although a huge amount of history trajectories can be achieved in the
   era of big data, it is still far from covering all the query
   trajectories since a road network is widely distributed and trajectory
   data is sparse. The temporal sensitivity of history trajectories
   highlights the sparsity problem even more. Therefore, we propose a novel
   model T-DesP to solve the aforementioned problems. The model is
   comprised of two modules: trajectory learning and destination
   prediction. In the module of trajectory learning, a novel method called
   the mirror absorbing Markov chain model is proposed for modeling the
   trajectories for isolating the destination. We build a transition tensor
   to deduce the transition probability between each location pair in a
   particular time slot. To address the data sparsity problem, we fill the
   missing values in transition tensor through a context-aware tensor
   decomposition approach. In the module of destination prediction, an
   absorbing tensor is derived from the filled transition tensor, and the
   theoretical model is established for destination prediction. The
   experiments prove the effectiveness and efficiency of T-DesP.

AB The current age of increased people mobility calls for a better
   understanding of how people move: how many places does an individual
   commonly visit, what are the semantics of these places, and how do
   people get from one place to another. We show that the number of places
   visited by each person (Points of Interest - PoIs) is regulated by some
   properties that are statistically similar among individuals.
   Subsequently, we present a Pals classification in terms of their
   relevance on a per-user basis. In addition to the Pols relevance, we
   also investigate the variables that describe the travel rules among PoIs
   in particular, the spatial and temporal distance. As regards the latter,
   existing works on mobility are mainly based on spatial distance. Here we
   argue, rather, that for human mobility the temporal distance and the
   Pols relevance are the major driving factors. Moreover, we study the
   semantic of Pols. This is useful for deriving statistics on people's
   habits without breaking their privacy. With the support of different
   datasets, our paper provides an in-depth analysis of Pols distribution
   and semantics; it also shows that our results hold independently of the
   nature of the dataset in use. We illustrate that our approach is able to
   effectively extract a rich set of features describing human mobility and
   we argue that this can be seminal to novel mobility research. (C) 2016

AB Most of the existing algorithms cannot effectively solve the data sparse
   problem of trajectory prediction. This paper proposes a novel sparse
   trajectory prediction method based on L-Z entropy estimation. Firstly,
   the moving region of trajectories is divided into a two-dimensional
   plane grid graph, and then the original trajectories are mapped to the
   grid graph so that each trajectory can be represented as a grid
   sequence. Secondly, an L-Z entropy estimator is used to calculate the
   entropy value of each grid sequence, and then the trajectory which has a
   comparatively low entropy value is segmented into several
   sub-trajectories. The new trajectory space is synthesised by these
   sub-trajectories based on trajectory entropy. The trajectory synthesis
   can not only resolve the sparse problem of trajectory data, but also
   make the new trajectory space more credible. In addition, the trajectory
   scale is limited in a certain range. Finally, under the new trajectory
   space, Markov model and Bayesian Inference is applied to trajectory
   prediction with data sparsity. The experiments based on the taxi
   trajectory dataset of Microsoft Research Asia show the proposed method
   can make an effective prediction for the sparse trajectory. Compared
   with the existing methods, our method needs a smaller trajectory space
   and provides much wider predicting range, faster predicting speed and
   better predicting accuracy.

AB Harnessing the latent knowledge present in geospatial trajectories
   allows for the potential to revolutionise our understanding of
   behaviour. This paper discusses one component of such analysis, namely
   the extraction of significant locations. Specifically, we: (i) present
   the Gradient-based Visit Extractor (GVE) algorithm capable of extracting
   periods of low mobility from geospatial data, while maintaining
   resilience to noise, and addressing the drawbacks of existing
   techniques, (ii) provide a comprehensive analysis of the properties of
   these visits and consequent locations, extracted through clustering, and
   (iii) demonstrate the applicability of GVE to the problem of visit
   extraction with respect to representative use-cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Human mobility is important for understanding the evolution of size and
   structure of urban areas, the spatial distribution of facilities, and
   the provision of transportation services. Until recently, exploring
   human mobility in detail was challenging because data collection methods
   consisted of cumbersome manual travel surveys, space-time diaries, or
   interviews. The development of location-aware sensors has significantly
   altered the possibilities for acquiring detailed data on human
   movements. Although this has spurred many methodological developments in
   identifying human movement patterns, many of these methods operate
   solely from the analytical perspective and ignore the environmental
   context within which the movement takes place. In this paper we attempt
   to widen this view and present an integrated approach to the analysis of
   human mobility using a combination of volunteered GPS trajectories and
   contextual spatial information. We propose a new framework for the
   identification of dynamic (travel modes) and static (significant places)
   behaviour using trajectory segmentation, data mining, and
   spatio-temporal analysis. We are interested in examining if and how
   travel modes depend on the residential location, age, or gender of the
   tracked individuals. Further, we explore theorised 'third places', which
   are spaces beyond main locations (home/work) where individuals spend
   time to socialise. Can these places be identified from GPS traces? We
   evaluate our framework using a collection of trajectories from 205
   volunteers linked to contextual spatial information on the types of
   places visited and the transport routes they use. The result of this
   study is a contextually enriched data set that supports new
   possibilities for modelling human movement behaviour.

AB Accurate home location is increasingly important for urban computing.
   Existing methods either rely on continuous (and expensive) Global
   Positioning System (GPS) data or suffer from poor accuracy. In
   particular, the sparse and noisy nature of social media data poses
   serious challenges in pinpointing where people live at scale. We revisit
   this research topic and infer home location within 100 mx100 m squares
   at 70% accuracy for 76% and 71% of active users in New York City and the
   Bay Area, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   time home location has been detected at such a fine granularity using
   sparse and noisy data. Since people spend a large portion of their time
   at home, our model enables novel applications. As an example, we focus
   on modeling people's health at scale by linking their home locations
   with publicly available statistics, such as education disparity. Results
   in multiple geographic regions demonstrate both the effectiveness and
   added value of our home localization method and reveal insights that
   eluded earlier studies. In addition, we are able to discover the real
   buzz in the communities where people live.

AB Private transport accounts for a large amount of total CO2 emissions,
   thus significantly contributing to global warming. Tools that actively
   support people in engaging in a more sustainable life-style without
   restricting their mobility are urgently needed. How can location-aware
   information and communication technology (ICT) enable novel interactive
   and participatory approaches that help people in becoming more
   sustainable? In this survey paper, we discuss the different aspects of
   this challenge from a technological and cognitive engineering
   perspective, based on an overview of the main information processes that
   may influence mobility behavior. We review the state-of-the-art of
   research with respect to various ways of influencing mobility behavior
   (e.g., through providing real-time, user-specific, and location-based
   feedback) and suggest a corresponding research agenda. We conclude that
   future research has to focus on reflecting individual goals in providing
   personal feedback and recommendations that take into account different
   motivational stages. In addition, a long-term and large-scale empirical
   evaluation of such tools is necessary.

AB Human personality has been largely considered to be associated with a
   preference for location. Maybe an adequate method applied to real-world
   data of both human personality and location may reveal that these two
   have a relationship. Two types of data were collected for this study.
   The Big Five Factors representing the human personality were collected
   by performing a Big Five Inventory of the participants of this study,
   and the participants' positioning data was collected by using portable
   positioning devices, such as GPS receivers and/or Smartphones. The
   positioning data can be translated into human mobility, which indicates
   the preference for different locations as well as the mobile trajectory.
   A total of five volunteers provided their positioning data for a period
   of six months, and a back propagation network was used to analyze the
   personality data and the corresponding location data in order to
   identify patterns present in the data. A total of 16,807 data points was
   produced, and the relationship between the personality data and the
   location data was found by using regression analysis where the
   personality data were considered as the independent variable and the
   location data as the dependent variable. The results indicate a
   functional relationship and meaning between personality and location, as
   presented in this paper.
