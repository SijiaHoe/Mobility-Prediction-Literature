AB The analysis of persons' indoor movement and behavior patterns can be of
   great value. Such an analysis enables managers and organizers in
   understanding the needs of customers and visitors. Event planning for
   exhibitions, festivals, and conferences, but also optimization of malls
   and stores can benefit from recorded visitor data. To show the advantage
   of visual analysis of movement information, we apply a new visual
   approach to a large indoor dataset, recorded at the re: publica
   conference in 2013. We present three different interactive visualization
   methods to reveal patterns, to deduce behavior from participants'
   movements, and to show transitions between sessions and topics. For
   this, we apply a spectral hierarchical clustering approach and visualize
   results in a pixel based scarf plot. Additionally, we introduce a
   prediction model and visualization which serves as a monitoring tool for
   visitor attraction and distribution and helps to prevent bottleneck
   situations. We evaluate our approach by showing its applicability in a
   case study and validate our model on ground truth data.

AB This paper proposes an automatic approach to build tailored dimensions
   for movement data warehouses based on views of existing hierarchies of
   objects (and their respective classes) used to semantically annotate
   movement segments. It selects the objects (classes) that annotate at
   least a given number of segments of a movement dataset to delineate
   hierarchy views for deriving tailored analysis dimensions for that
   movement dataset. Dimensions produced in this way can be quite smaller
   than the hierarchies from which they are extracted, leading to
   efficiency gains, among other potential benefits. Results of experiments
   with tweets semantically enriched with points of interest taken from
   linked open data collections show the viability of the proposed
   approach.

AB In mobile Internet, popular Location-Based Services (LBSs) recommend
   Point-of-Interest (POI) data according to physical positions of
   smartphone users. However, untrusted LBS providers can violate location
   privacy by analyzing user requests semantically. Therefore, this paper
   aims at protecting user privacy in location-based applications by
   evaluating disclosure risks on sensitive location semantics. First, we
   introduce a novel method to model location semantics for user privacy
   using Bayesian inference and demonstrate details of computing the
   semantic privacy metric. Next, we design a cloaking region construction
   algorithm against the leakage of sensitive location semantics. Finally,
   a series of experiments evaluate this solution's performance to show its
   availability.

AB People using mobile devices for making phone calls, accessing the
   internet, or posting georeferenced contents in social media create
   episodic digital traces of their presence in various places.
   Availability of personal traces over a long time period makes it
   possible to detect repeatedly visited places and identify them as home,
   work, place of social activities, etc. based on temporal patterns of the
   person's presence. Such analysis, however, can compromise personal
   privacy. We propose a visual analytics approach to semantic analysis of
   mobility data in which traces of a large number of people are processed
   simultaneously without accessing individual-level data. After extracting
   personal places and identifying their meanings in this
   privacy-respectful manner, the original georeferenced data are
   transformed to trajectories in an abstract semantic space. The
   semantically abstracted data can be further analyzed without the risk of
   re-identifying people based on the specific places they attend.

AB Nowadays, the increasing development of positioning and wireless
   communication technologies favors a better real-time integration and
   manipulation of large spatial databases. This offers many new
   opportunities for the development of trajectory databases, but a number
   of research challenges are still open as the generated information is
   often unstructured, continuous, large and sometimes unpredictable. The
   research presented in this paper develops a modeling approach that
   integrates the semantic, spatial and temporal dimensions when
   representing spatial trajectories at the abstract and logical levels. A
   data manipulation language that supports the querying and analysis of
   large trajectory databases is also proposed. The spatial database model
   is based on algebraic data types, and a prototype is developed on top of
   the DBMS PostgreSQL/PostGIS. The whole approach and the prototype
   development have been experimented and applied to benchmark
   transportation data derived from an origin-destination survey in the
   region of Quebec in Canada.

AB Trajectories have been providing us with a wealth of derived information
   such as traffic conditions and road network updates. This work focuses
   on deriving user profiles through spatiotemporal analysis of trajectory
   data to provide insight into the quality of information provided by
   users. The presented behavior profiling method assesses user
   participation characteristics in a treasure-hunt type event. Consisting
   of an analysis and a profiling phase, analysis involves a timeline and a
   stay-point analysis, as well as a semantic trajectory inspection
   relating actual and expected paths. The analysis results are then
   grouped around profiles that can be used to estimate the user
   performance in the activity. The proposed profiling method is evaluated
   by means of a student orientation treasure-hunt activity at the
   University of Twente, The Netherlands. The profiling method is used to
   predict the students' gaming behavior by means of a simple team type
   classification, and a feature-based answer type classification.

AB Movement data sets collected using today's advanced tracking devices
   consist of complex trajectories in terms of length, shape, and number of
   recorded positions. Multiple additional attributes characterizing the
   movement and its environment are often also included making the level of
   complexity even higher. Simplification of trajectories can improve the
   visibility of relevant information by reducing less relevant details
   while maintaining important movement patterns. We propose a systematic
   stepwise methodology for simplifying and thematically enhancing
   trajectories in order to support their visual analysis. The methodology
   is applied iteratively and is composed of: (a) a simplification step
   applied to reduce the morphological complexity of the trajectories, (b)
   a thematic enhancement step which aims at accentuating patterns of
   movement, and (c) the representation and interactive exploration of the
   results in order to make interpretations of the findings and further
   refinement to the simplification and enhancement process. We illustrate
   our methodology through an analysis example of two different types of
   tracks, aircraft and pedestrian movement.

   research topic spanning across different disciplines and with strong
   societal implications and expectations. The tumultuous growth of the
   mobile applications market over the past few years has however hindered
   the development of a systematic organization and classification of
   location privacy concepts. In this paper we focus on one of the key
   concepts, i.e. location privacy metric. We survey existing approaches to
   the measurement of location privacy and propose a classification
   framework. The notion of location privacy metric, however, cannot be
   fully understood without describing the context in which these metrics
   are used. To that extent we elaborate on the notions of application
   model and privacy model. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the
   specification of a conceptual framework for location privacy.

AB In recent years, there has been tremendous growth in the field of indoor
   and outdoor positioning sensors continuously producing huge volumes of
   trajectory data that has been used in many fields such as location-based
   services or location intelligence. Trajectory data is massively
   increased and semantically complicated, which poses a great challenge on
   spatio-temporal data indexing. This paper proposes a spatio-temporal
   data indexing method, named HBSTR-tree, which is a hybrid index
   structure comprising spatio-temporal R-tree, B*-tree and Hash table. To
   improve the index generation efficiency, rather than directly inserting
   trajectory points, we group consecutive trajectory points as nodes
   according to their spatio-temporal semantics and then insert them into
   spatio-temporal R-tree as leaf nodes. Hash table is used to manage the
   latest leaf nodes to reduce the frequency of insertion. A new
   spatio-temporal interval criterion and a new node-choosing sub-algorithm
   are also proposed to optimize spatio-temporal R-tree structures. In
   addition, a B*-tree sub-index of leaf nodes is built to query the
   trajectories of targeted objects efficiently. Furthermore, a database
   storage scheme based on a NoSQL-type DBMS is also proposed for the
   purpose of cloud storage. Experimental results prove that HBSTR-tree
   outperforms TB*-tree in some aspects such as generation efficiency,
   query performance and query type.

AB The behavior of moving objects has been a relevant source of information
   to intelligent mobile systems. However, most of existing works on
   trajectory representation deal only with basic characteristics of
   trajectories, such as space and time, while these attributes may be not
   enough to provide the required information to intelligent systems. We
   observe that the analysis of other characteristics (e.g. speed and
   acceleration) of mobile objects enriches the trajectory description as
   well as open opportunities to novel applications. However, the dynamic
   nature of these characteristics brings several challenges related to the
   preprocessing and analysis of raw data. In this paper, we show how these
   additional characteristics may be integrated in trajectory modeling. We
   address the problem of representing trajectories with qualitative
   descriptions of movement modeled as an ontology. We validate our
   approach with real data from a sport tracking application.

   to set a deterministic walking threshold. However during transfer people
   generally move slowly or wait for a while and thus the spatio-temporal
   points are located close to each other and tend to form clusters. To
   mitigate such problems an adaptive density-based fuzzy approach is
   proposed for detecting transfers and activities performed during

AB The increasing availability of animal tracking data brings us
   opportunities and challenges to intuitively understand the mechanisms of

   patterns from animal trajectory data. In particular, we propose a notion
   of continuous activity pattern as the concise representation of
   underlying similar spatio-temporal movements, and develop an extension
   and refinement framework to discover the patterns. We first preprocess
   the trajectories into significant semantic locations with time property.
   Then, we apply a projection-based approach to generate candidate
   patterns and refine them to generate true patterns. A sequence graph
   structure and a simple and effective processing strategy is further
   developed to reduce the computational overhead. The proposed approaches
   are extensively validated on both real GPS datasets and large synthetic
   datasets.

AB The effective analysis and understanding of huge amount of mobility data
   have been a hot research topic in the last few years. In this paper, we
   introduce Mob-Warehouse, a Trajectory Data Warehouse which goes a step
   further to the state of the art on mobility analysis since it models
   trajectories enriched with semantics. The unit of movement is the
   (spatio-temporal) point endowed with several semantic dimensions
   including the activity, the transportation means and the mobility
   patterns. This model allows us to answer the classical Why, Who, When,
   Where, What, How questions providing an aggregated view of different
   aspects of the user movements, no longer limited to space and time. We
   briefly present an experiment of Mob-Warehouse on a real dataset.

AB With increasing use of GPS devices more and more location-based
   information is accessible. Thus not only more movements of people are
   tracked but also POI (point of interest) information becomes available
   in increasing geo-spatial density. To enable analysis of movement
   behavior, we present an approach to enrich trajectory data with semantic
   POI information and show how additional insights can be gained. Using a
   density-based clustering technique we extract 1.215 frequent
   destinations of similar to 150.000 user movements from a large
   e-mobility database. We query available context information from
   Foursquare, a popular location-based social network, to enrich the
   destinations with semantic background. As GPS measurements can be noisy,
   often more then one possible destination is found and movement patterns
   vary over time. Therefore we present highly interactive visualizations
   that enable an analyst to cope with the inherent geospatial and
   behavioral uncertainties.

AB The main search engines nowadays are able to quickly perform searches on
   texts, images, audio or video. Recently a growing interest was devoted
   to the searching in the field of a new type of data resulting from the
   storage of GPS tracks: the trajectories. Therefore, we need to consider
   new searching strategies and methods fit to these data structures. The
   idea is to design a search engine aimed at the indexing and retrieving
   trajectories in specific repositories. This paper describes a starting
   framework for semantic analysis of trajectories data. This framework
   aims at detecting and extracting features from GPS raw data. These
   elements, in turn, populate new feature vectors in a MIRS Multimedia
   Browsing Indexing and Retrieval System, to support location-based
   queries. For several reasons, the feature extraction process starting
   from raw GPS data is a multiple steps process. The raw GPS data are
   affected by noise and inaccuracies; the trajectories are not uniform and
   homogeneous data because, for example, they are drawn by repeatedly
   changing the means of locomotion. Furthermore, the usual sections of
   trajectory ('trip segments'), describing a motion with certain kinematic
   parameters, could be alternated with slowly strolling around in confined
   areas ('activity') such as a mall, a gym or a small market. The reasons
   listed above require the pre-processing of the raw GPS data in order to
   split the paths into uniform and homogeneous subsets. The pre-processing
   step removes the noise from the trajectories and separates the 'trip
   segments' from the 'activities'. Next, each 'trip segment' is classified
   using a sequence of two detection techniques based on fuzzy logic and
   SVM. Finally, the synthetized trajectory components are stored in
   feature vectors, ready to start location-based queries for retrieval
   systems. The indexed trajectories will allow the queries in a database,
   for example, on both on-road routes and off-road trails. The model
   proposed in this framework provides the basis module for support
   retrieving of pre-compiled trajectories but instead not supports the
   streaming of trajectories if the trajectory is not yet fully completed.

AB To support knowledge discovery from data, many pattern mining techniques
   have been proposed. One of the bottlenecks for their dissemination is
   the number of computed patterns that appear to be either trivial or
   uninteresting with respect to available knowledge. Integration of domain
   knowledge in constraint-based data mining is limited. Relevant patterns
   still miss because methods partly fail in assessing their subjective
   interestingness. However, in practice, we often have in the literature
   mathematical models defined by experts based on their domain knowledge.
   We propose here to exploit such models to derive constraints that can be
   used during the data mining phase to improve both pattern relevancy and
   computational efficiency. Even though the approach is generic, it is
   illustrated on pattern set discovery from real data for studying soil
   erosion.

AB Searching for the group members that participate in a joint action based
   on collecting and analyzing the position information of moving objects
   could provide an important support for the decision makers in the fields
   such as the investigation of criminal cases, group emergency disposal, a
   large- scale military action etc. Following the pattern analysis of
   mobile objects based on their position information, this paper proposes
   a group member search method for mobile objects based on pattern
   similarity, which identifies group members by utilizing the correlation
   information of the mobility attributes such as trajectory, speed,
   direction and acceleration. Compared with group clustering or
   classification based on trajectory distance, the overlapping
   interference can be effectively avoided between members in different
   groups, and this method fits the objective law of group movement better.
   Combining with the application background, the experimental analysis
   confirms that the proposed method can quickly and accurately find the
   group members.

AB Maritime security is critical for protecting sea lanes, ports,
   harborsand other critical infrastructure against a broad range of
   threats and illegal activities like smuggling, human trafficking, piracy
   and terrorism. Limited resources constrain maritime domain awareness and
   compromise full security coverage at all times. This situation calls for
   innovative intelligent systems for interactive situation analysis to
   assist marine authorities and security personal in their routine
   surveillance operations. In this paper, we propose a novel situation
   analysis approach to analyze, detect and differentiate a range of
   interaction patterns and anomalies of interest for marine vessels that
   operate over some period of time in relative proximity to each other. We
   analyze vessel interaction scenarios to model common patterns as
   probabilistic processes in terms of hidden Markov models. To
   differentiate suspicious activities from unobjectionable behavior, we
   explore fusion of data and information from observable behavior
   (geospatial aspects, kinematic features and contextual information) and
   maritime domain knowledge from diverse sources. Our experimental
   evaluation using real-world vessel tracking data shows the effectiveness
   of the approach.

AB In geographic information science, a plethora of different approaches
   and methods is used to assess the similarity of movement. Some of these
   approaches term two moving objects similar if they share akin paths.
   Others require objects to move at similar speed and yet others consider
   movement similar if it occurs at the same time. We believe that a
   structured and comprehensive classification of movement comparison
   measures is missing. We argue that such a classification not only
   depicts the status quo of qualitative and quantitative movement
   analysis, but also allows for identifying those aspects of movement for
   which similarity measures are scarce or entirely missing.
   In this review paper we, first, decompose movement into its spatial,
   temporal, and spatiotemporal movement parameters. A movement parameter
   is a physical quantity of movement, such as speed, spatial path, or
   temporal duration. For each of these parameters we then review
   qualitative and quantitative methods of how to compare movement. Thus,
   we provide a systematic and comprehensive classification of different
   movement similarity measures used in geographic information science.
   This classification is a valuable first step toward a GIS toolbox
   comprising all relevant movement comparison methods.
