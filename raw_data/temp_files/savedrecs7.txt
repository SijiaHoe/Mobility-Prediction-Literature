AB Mobile phones have evolved from devices that are just used for voice and
   text communication to platforms that are able to capture and transmit a
   range of data types (image, audio, and location). The adoption of these
   increasingly capable devices by society has enabled a potentially
   pervasive sensing paradigm - participatory sensing. A coordinated
   participatory sensing system engages individuals carrying mobile phones
   to explore phenomena of interest using in situ data collection. For
   participatory sensing to succeed, several technical challenges need to
   be solved. In this paper, we discuss one particular issue: developing a
   recruitment framework to enable organizers to identify well-suited
   participants for data collections based on geographic and temporal
   availability as well as participation habits. This recruitment system is
   evaluated through a series of pilot data collections where volunteers
   explored sustainable processes on a university campus.

   in an indoor environment is not easy without the use of specific
   infrastructures. In this article, we introduce an indoor user tracking
   system. The system constructs a topological map with Wi-Fi signal
   calibrations, assigns semantically meaningful labels into the map, and
   estimates the semantic location of the user based on the current Wi-Fi
   observation. The system does not require a geometric map, or costly
   radio map building process. We implemented the system with the
   off-the-shelf Smartphone and experimentally validated the scheme.

AB Recently, activity-based analysis using GPS equipment as data collector
   has being a hot issue. But most researches focus on data from wearable
   GPS recorder for person because of easy detailed activity logging and
   interactive validation with users. Nevertheless, available floating car
   data and geographic context databases provide the possibility for
   activity-based analysis based on GPS vehicle tracking trajectories, this
   paper presents a novel and efficient approach to automatically identify
   activity-locations as well as activity-types from raw GPS vehicle
   tracking data. A number of contextual variants related to the activity
   locations including temporal information, spatial information and
   probability information are considered with the help of digital map
   containing Points of Interest (POIS). Taking the three aspects of inputs
   mentioned above into a Multi-Variants Analysis framework, detailed
   information of each activity will be identified. Finally, experiments
   using real world floating car data are conducted for evaluation and to
   show how this approach will help in varieties of applications in both
   traffic and activity-based analysis.

SE IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (Globecom)
PD 2010
PY 2010
AB This paper introduces a novel method of generating mobility traces based
   on Probabilistic Context Free Grammars (PCFGs). A PCFG is a
   generalization of a context free grammar in which each production rule
   is augmented with a probability with which this production is applied
   during sentence generation. A concise PCFG can be inferred from the
   given real world trace collected from the actual mobile node behaviors.
   The resulting grammar can be used to generate sequences of arbitrary
   length mimicking the mobile node behavior. This is important when new
   protocol designs for mobile networks are tested by simulation.
   In the paper, we describe the methods developed to construct such
   grammars from training data (mobility history). We also discuss how to
   generate the synthetic data with an already constructed grammar. We
   present the experimental results on two real data sets, measuring
   similarity of the actual traces with the synthetic ones. We compare our
   grammar based method to a 2-level Markov Model based trace generation
   method. The results demonstrate that the grammar based approach works as
   an excellent compression method for the actual data. On many metrics,
   the synthetic data generated from the PCFG match the training data much
   better than the one generated by the Markov Model.

AB In the use of a wearable GPS and cellular tracker for applications such
   as elderly tracking, device power consumption is an important
   consideration. To save power, assisted GPS (AGPS) location fixes should
   not be performed frequently. On the other hand, we also do not want to
   lose important information about the user's mobility patterns and
   routines. To solve this dilemma, in this paper, we present the design of
   a system that intelligently schedules on-line AGPS location fixes only
   when necessary based on information extracted from user's historical
   mobility data, and then reconstruct the user path based on these
   sparsely taken on-line location fixes. Experimental results show that
   our on-line algorithm can significantly reduce the number of AGPS fixes
   needed and the reconstruction method works well without a priori
   knowledge of a map and streets information.

TI Closed-Form Path-Loss Predictor for Gaussianly Distributed Nodes
SO 2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS

PY 2010
AB The emulation of wireless nodes spatial position is a practice used by
   deployment engineers and network planners to analyze the characteristics
   of a network. In particular, nodes geolocation will directly impact
   factors such as connectivity, signals fidelity, and service quality. In
   literature, in addition to typical homogenous scattering, normal
   distribution is frequently used to model mobiles concentration in a
   cellular system. Moreover, Gaussian dropping is often considered as an
   effective placement method for airborne sensor deployment. Despite the
   practicality of this model, getting the network channel loss
   distribution still relies on exhaustive Monte Carlo simulation. In this
   paper, we argue the need for this inefficient approach and hence derived
   a generic and exact closed-form expression for the path-loss
   distribution density between a base-station and a network of nodes.
   Simulation was used to reaffirm the validity of the theoretical analysis
   using values from the new IEEE 802.20 standard.

AB Over the last ten years, electronic vehicle guidance systems have become
   increasingly popular. However, their performance is subject to the
   availability and accuracy of digital road maps. Most current digital
   maps are still inadequate for advanced applications in unstructured
   environments. Lack of detailed up-to-date information and insufficient
   accuracy and refinement of the road geometry are among the most
   important shortcomings. The massive use of inexpensive GPS receivers,
   combined with the rapidly increasing availability of wireless
   communication infrastructure, suggests that large volumes of data
   combining both modalities will be available in a near future. The
   approach presented here draws on machine learning techniques to process
   logs of position traces to consistently build a detailed and accurate
   representation of the road network and, more importantly, extract the
   actual paths followed by vehicles. Experimental results with data from
   large mining operations are presented to validate the algorithm.

AB User mobility has given rise to a variety of Web applications, in which
   the global positioning system (GPS) plays many important roles in
   bridging between these applications and end users. As a kind of human
   behavior, transportation modes, such as walking and driving, can provide
   pervasive computing systems with more contextual information and enrich
   a user's mobility with informative knowledge. In this article, we report
   on an approach based on supervised learning to automatically infer
   users' transportation modes, including driving, walking, taking a bus
   and riding a bike, from raw GPS logs. Our approach consists of three
   parts: a change point-based segmentation method, an inference model and
   a graph-based post-processing algorithm. First, we propose a change
   point-based segmentation method to partition each GPS trajectory into
   separate segments of different transportation modes. Second, from each
   segment, we identify a set of sophisticated features, which are not
   affected by differing traffic conditions ( e. g., a person's direction
   when in a car is constrained more by the road than any change in traffic
   conditions). Later, these features are fed to a generative inference
   model to classify the segments of different modes. Third, we conduct
   graph-based postprocessing to further improve the inference performance.
   This postprocessing algorithm considers both the commonsense constraints
   of the real world and typical user behaviors based on locations in a
   probabilistic manner. The advantages of our method over the related
   works include three aspects. ( 1) Our approach can effectively segment
   trajectories containing multiple transportation modes. ( 2) Our work
   mined the location constraints from user-generated GPS logs, while being
   independent of additional sensor data and map information like road
   networks and bus stops. ( 3) The model learned from the dataset of some
   users can be applied to infer GPS data from others. Using the GPS logs
   collected by 65 people over a period of 10 months, we evaluated our
   approach via a set of experiments. As a result, based on the
   change-point-based segmentation method and Decision Tree-based inference
   model, we achieved prediction accuracy greater than 71 percent. Further,
   using the graph-based post-processing algorithm, the performance
   attained a 4-percent enhancement.

AB We present a fast algorithm for probabilistically extracting significant
   locations from raw GPS data based on data point density. Extracting
   significant locations from raw GPS data is the first essential step of
   algorithms designed for location-aware applications. Assuming that a
   location is significant if users spend a certain time around that area,
   most current algorithms compare spatial/temporal variables, such as stay
   duration and a roaming diameter, with given fixed thresholds to extract
   significant locations. However, the appropriate threshold values are not
   clearly known in priori and algorithms with fixed thresholds are
   inherently error-prone, especially under high noise levels. Moreover,
   for N data points, they are generally O(N-2) algorithms since distance
   computation is required. We developed a fast algorithm for selective
   data point sampling around significant locations based on density
   information by constructing random histograms using locality sensitive
   hashing. Evaluations show competitive performance in detecting
   significant locations even under high noise levels.

   object based on a contact sound. A life log system records our behaviors
   for recommending appropriate information depending on logs. There are
   some devices including a camera, a microphone and a GPS for recording
   our actions. However, those devices record too rich information to be
   accepted in terms of privacy. In this research we focus on the sound
   when we touch/manipulate objects. A piezoelectric device on a fingernail
   records touching sound propagating through a fingertip. Since the
   recorded sound depends on touching objects, we can record what we
   touched. This can be used as a new life log which assures secrecy. We
   show that our prototype system recognizes 12 different actions with
   94.4% accuracy.

AB Continuous sensing applications (e.g., mobile social networking
   applications) are appearing on new sensor-enabled mobile phones such as
   the Apple iPhone, Nokia and Android phones. These applications present
   significant challenges to the phone's operations given the phone's
   limited computational and energy resources and the need for applications
   to share real-time continuous sensed data with back-end servers. System
   designers have to deal with a trade-off between data accuracy (i.e.,
   application fidelity) and energy constraints in the design of uploading
   strategies between phones and back-end servers. In this paper, we
   present the design, implementation and evaluation of several techniques
   to optimize the information uploading process for continuous sensing on
   mobile phones. We analyze the cases of continuous and intermittent
   connectivity imposed by low-duty cycle design considerations or poor
   wireless network coverage in order to drive down energy consumption and
   extend the lifetime of the phone. We also show how location prediction
   can be integrated into this forecasting framework. We present the
   implementation and the experimental evaluation of these uploading
   techniques based on measurements from the deployment of a continuous
   sensing application on 20 Nokia N95 phones used by 20 people for a
   period of 2 weeks. Our results show that we can make significant energy
   savings while limiting the impact on the application fidelity, making
   continuous sensing a viable application for mobile phones. For example,
   we show that it is possible to achieve an accuracy of 80% with respect
   to ground-truth data while saving 60% of the traffic sent over-the-air.

AB Constructing models of mobile agents can be difficult without
   domain-specific knowledge. Parametric models flexible enough to capture
   all mobility patterns that an expert believes are possible are often
   large, requiring a great deal of training data. In contrast,
   nonparametric models are extremely flexible and can generalize well with
   relatively little training data. We propose modeling the mobility
   patterns of moving agents as a mixture of Gaussian processes (GP) with a
   Dirichlet process (DP) prior over mixture weights. The GP provides a
   flexible representation for each individual mobility pattern, while the
   DP assigns observed trajectories to particular mobility patterns. Both
   the GPs and the DP adjust the model's complexity based on available
   data, implicitly avoiding issues of over-fitting or under-fitting. We
   apply our model to a helicopter-based tracking task, where the mobility
   patterns of the tracked agents-cars-are learned from real data collected
   from taxis in the greater Boston area.

AB Most location sharing applications display people's locations on a map.
   However, people use a rich variety of terms to refer to their locations,
   such as "home," "Starbucks," or "the bus stop near my house." Our
   long-term goal is to create a system that can automatically generate
   appropriate place names based on real-time context and user preferences.
   As a first step, we analyze data from a two-week study involving 26
   participants in two different cities, focusing on how people refer to
   places in location sharing. We derive a taxonomy of different place
   naming methods, and show that factors such as a person's perceived
   familiarity with a place and the entropy of that place (i.e. the variety
   of people who visit it) strongly influence the way people refer to it
   when interacting with others. We also present a machine learning model
   for predicting how people name places. Using our data, this model is
   able to predict the place naming method people choose with an average
   accuracy higher than 85%.

AB Traveling to unfamiliar regions require a significant effort from novice
   travelers to plan where to go within a limited duration. In this paper,
   we propose a smart recommendation for highly efficient and balanced
   itineraries based on multiple user-generated GPS trajectories. Users
   only need to provide a. minimal query composed of a start point, an end
   point and travel duration to receive an itinerary recommendation. To
   differentiate good itinerary candidates from less fulfilling ones, we
   describe how we model and define itinerary in terms of several
   characteristics mined from user-generated GPS trajectories. Further, we
   evaluated the efficiency of our method based on 17,745 user-generated
   GPS trajectories contributed by 125 users in Beijing, China. Also we
   performed a user study where current residents of Beijing used our
   system to review and give ratings to itineraries generated by our
   algorithm and baseline algorithms for comparison.

AB The sensing context plays an important role in many pervasive and mobile
   computing applications. Continuing from previous work [D. Phung, B.
   Adams, S. Venkatesh, Computable social patterns from sparse sensor data,
   in: Proceedings of First International Workshop on Location Web, World
   Wide Web Conference (WWW), New York, NY, USA, 2008, ACM 69-72.], we
   present an unsupervised framework for extracting user context in indoor
   environments with existing wireless infrastructures. Our novel approach
   casts context detection into an incremental, unsupervised clustering
   setting. Using WiFi observations consisting of access point
   identification and signal strengths freely available in office or public
   spaces, we adapt a density-based clustering technique to recover basic
   forms of user contexts that include user motion state and significant
   places the user visits from time to time. High-level user context,
   termed rhythms, comprising sequences of significant places are derived
   from the above low-level context by employing probabilistic clustering
   techniques, latent Dirichlet allocation and its n-gram temporal
   extension. These user contexts can enable a wide range of context-ware
   application services. Experimental results with real data in comparison
   with existing methods are presented to validate the proposed approach.
   Our motion classification algorithm operates in real-time, and achieves
   a 10% improvement over an existing method; significant locations are
   detected with over 90% accuracy and near perfect cluster purity. Richer
   indoor context and meaningful rhythms, such as typical daily routines or
   meeting patterns, are also inferred automatically from collected raw
   WiFi signals. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Our understanding of the effects of human movement on dengue
   virus spread remains limited in part due to the lack of precise tools to
   monitor the time-dependent location of individuals. We determined the
   utility of a new, commercially available, GPS data-logger for long-term
   tracking of human movements in Iquitos, Peru. We conducted a series of
   evaluations focused on GPS device attributes key to reliable use and
   accuracy. GPS observations from two participants were later compared
   with semi-structured interview data to assess the usefulness of GPS
   technology to track individual mobility patterns.
   Results: Positional point and line accuracy were 4.4 and 10.3 m,
   respectively. GPS wearing mode increased spatial point error by 6.9 m.
   Units were worn on a neck-strap by a carpenter and a moto-taxi driver
   for 14-16 days. The application of a clustering algorithm (I-cluster) to
   the raw GPS positional data allowed the identification of locations
   visited by each participant together with the frequency and duration of
   each visit. The carpenter moved less and spent more time in more fixed
   locations than the moto-taxi driver, who visited more locations for a
   shorter period of time. GPS and participants' interviews concordantly
   identified 6 common locations, whereas GPS alone identified 4 locations
   and participants alone identified 10 locations. Most (80%) of the
   locations identified by participants alone were places reported as
   visited for less than 30 minutes.
   Conclusion: The present study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel,
   commercially available GPS data-logger for long-term tracking of humans
   and shows the potential of these units to quantify mobility patterns in
   relationship with dengue virus transmission risk in a tropical urban
   environment. Cost, battery life, size, programmability and ease of wear
   are unprecedented from previously tested units, proving the usefulness
   of GPS-dataloggers for linking movement of individuals and transmission
   risk of dengue virus and other infectious agents, particularly in
   resource-poor settings.

AB Background: Human movement is a key behavioral factor in many
   vector-borne disease systems because it influences exposure to vectors
   and thus the transmission of pathogens. Human movement transcends
   spatial and temporal scales with different influences on disease
   dynamics. Here we develop a conceptual model to evaluate the importance
   of variation in exposure due to individual human movements for pathogen
   transmission, focusing on mosquito-borne dengue virus.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: We develop a model showing that the
   relevance of human movement at a particular scale depends on vector
   behavior. Focusing on the day-biting Aedes aegypti, we illustrate how
   vector biting behavior combined with fine-scale movements of individual
   humans engaged in their regular daily routine can influence
   transmission. Using a simple example, we estimate a transmission rate
   (R(0)) of 1.3 when exposure is assumed to occur only in the home versus
   3.75 when exposure at multiple locations-e. g., market, friend's-due to
   movement is considered. Movement also influences for which sites and
   individuals risk is greatest. For the example considered, intriguingly,
   our model predicts little correspondence between vector abundance in a
   site and estimated R(0) for that site when movement is considered. This
   illustrates the importance of human movement for understanding and
   predicting the dynamics of a disease like dengue. To encourage
   investigation of human movement and disease, we review methods currently
   available to study human movement and, based on our experience studying
   dengue in Peru, discuss several important questions to address when
   designing a study.
   Conclusions/Significance: Human movement is a critical, understudied
   behavioral component underlying the transmission dynamics of many
   vector-borne pathogens. Understanding movement will facilitate
   identification of key individuals and sites in the transmission of
   pathogens such as dengue, which then may provide targets for
   surveillance, intervention, and improved disease prevention.

AB Longitudinal behavioral data generally contains a significant amount of
   structure. In this work, we identify the structure inherent in daily
   behavior with models that can accurately analyze, predict, and cluster
   multimodal data from individuals and communities within the social
   network of a population. We represent this behavioral structure by the
   principal components of the complete behavioral dataset, a set of
   characteristic vectors we have termed eigenbehaviors. In our model, an
   individual's behavior over a specific day can be approximated by a
   weighted sum of his or her primary eigenbehaviors. When these weights
   are calculated halfway through a day, they can be used to predict the
   day's remaining behaviors with 79% accuracy for our test subjects.
   Additionally, we demonstrate the potential for this dimensionality
   reduction technique to infer community affiliations within the subjects'
   social network by clustering individuals into a "behavior space" spanned
   by a set of their aggregate eigenbehaviors. These behavior spaces make
   it possible to determine the behavioral similarity between both
   individuals and groups, enabling 96% classification accuracy of
   community affiliations within the population-level social network.
   Additionally, the distance between individuals in the behavior space can
   be used as an estimate for relational ties such as friendship,
   suggesting strong behavioral homophily amongst the subjects. This
   approach capitalizes on the large amount of rich data previously
   captured during the Reality Mining study from mobile phones continuously
   logging location, proximate phones, and communication of 100 subjects at
   MIT over the course of 9 months. As wearable sensors continue to
   generate these types of rich, longitudinal datasets, dimensionality
   reduction techniques such as eigenbehaviors will play an increasingly
   important role in behavioral research.

AB Services for mobile and pervasive computing should extensively exploit
   contextual information both to adapt to user needs and to enable
   autonomic behavior. To fulfill this idea it is important to provide two
   key tools: a model supporting context-data representation and
   manipulation, and a set of algorithms relying on the model to perform
   application tasks. Following these lines, we first describe the W4
   context model showing how it can represent a simple yet effective
   framework to enable flexible and general-purpose management of
   contextual information. In particular, we show the model suitability in
   describing user-centric situations, e.g., describing situations in terms
   of where a user is located and what he is doing. Then, we illustrate a
   set of algorithms to semantically enrich W4 represented data and to
   extract relevant information from it. In particular, starting from W4
   data, such algorithms are able to identify the places that matter to the
   user and to describe them semantically. Overall, we show how the
   context-model and the algorithms allow to create an high-level, semantic
   and context-aware diary-based service. This service meaningfully
   collects and classifies the user whereabouts and the places that the
   user visited.

   early warning systems, city-wide sensing applications such as air
   pollution exposure estimation and traffic planning. With the inclusion
   of new technologies in the cell phone hardware such as built-in GPS and

   forwarded to a remote system via opportunistic connections over
   Internet. However, it is very difficult to use these low level location
   data for practical applications due to lack of sufficient information

AB Wireless signal strength fingerprinting has become an increasingly
   popular technique for realizing indoor localization systems using
   existing WiFi infrastructures. However, these systems typically require
   a time-consuming and costly training phase to build the radio map.
   Moreover, since radio signals change and fluctuate over time, map
   maintenance requires continuous re-calibration. We introduce a new
   concept called "asynchronous interval labeling" that addresses these
   problems in the context of user-generated place labels. By using an
   accelerometer to detect whether a device is moving or stationary, the
   system can continuously and unobtrusively learn from all radio
   measurements during a stationary period, thus greatly increasing the
   number of available samples. Movement information also allows the system
   to improve the user experience by deferring labeling to a later, more
   suitable moment. Initial experiments with our system show considerable
   increases in data collected and improvements to inferred location
   likelihood, with negligible overhead reported by users.

AB We consider the problem of predicting user location in the form of
   user-cell association in a cellular wireless network. This is rnotivated
   by resource optimization, for example switching base transceiver
   stations on or off to save on network energy consumption. We use GSM
   traces obtained from an operator, and compare several prediction
   methods. First, we find that, on our trace data, user cell sector
   association can be correctly predicted in ca. 80% of the cases. Second,
   we propose a new method, called "MARPL", which uses Market Basket
   Analysis to separate patterns where prediction by partial match (PPM)
   works well from those where repetition of the last known location (LAST)
   is best. Third, we propose that for network resource optimization,
   predicting the aggregate location of a user ensemble may be of more
   interest than separate predictions for all users; this motivates us to
   develop soft prediction methods, where the prediction is a spatial
   probability distribution rather than the most likely location. Last, we
   compare soft predictions methods to a classical time and space analysis
   (ISTAR). In terms of relative mean square error, MARPL with soft
   prediction and ISTAR perform better than all other methods, with a

AB In this paper we propose a mass market solution on mobile phones to
   discover a user's significant places solely from observed cell IDs. It
   does not require either cell-ID-to-physical-location mapping or the
   capability of obtaining multiple cell IDs on the phone simultaneously,
   and is able to run on virtually any mobile phone today. Our solution is
   centered around a cell ID clustering algorithm based on temporal
   correlations. It is able to prevent over-clustering and handles missing
   data well. We evaluate the solution with real-life data that the author
   has collected over a period of eight weeks. Results show that we are
   able to discover not only places of utter importance, but also certain
   less frequently recurring places and one-time travel destinations that
   bear significance in one's life.

   able to receive location based information on the fly. A model that is
   able to predict a user's next destination will make location based
   services more effective by providing personalized information to the
   user. The implementation of such a location prediction model requires a
   set of correctly labeled destinations collected from users to tune the
   prediction model to an acceptable level of accuracy. A large collection
   of data will allow researchers to derive the parameters required to
   train predication models and also get the trends Of user behaviors in

   city. We demonstrate the potential of existing community detection
   methodologies to identify salient locations based on the network
   generated by tower transitions. The tower groupings from these
   unsupervised clustering techniques are subsequently validated using data
   from Bluetooth beacons placed in the homes of the subjects. We then use
   these inferred locations as states within several dynamic Bayesian
   networks (DBNs) to predict dwell times within locations and each
   subject's subsequent movements with over 90% accuracy. We also introduce
   the X-Factor model, a DBN with a latent variable corresponding to
   abnormal behavior. By calculating the entropy of the learned X-Factor
   model parameters, we find there are individuals across demographics who
   have a wide range of routine in their daily behavior. We conclude with a
   description of extensions for this model, such as incorporating
   contextual and temporal variables already being logged by the phones.

AB Mobility modeling is the mathematical modeling of mobile users' (cars,
   cell phone users) movement patterns. The resulting model not only
   provides us with an understanding of past mobile user movements, but
   also enables us to predict how a mobile user might move in the future.
   It has been found useful in both infrastructure-based wireless network
   and ad hoc network for protocol evaluation, resource planning, etc. A
   nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian approach is proposed in this paper
   for extracting hierarchical mobility patterns from mobile user traces.
   Experiment results show that the proposed method is able to generate a
   hierarchical mobility model that better reflect the mobility pattern
   structure in many scenarios. It also has better future movement
   prediction compared to the hidden Markov model.

   it is impossible to employ an adequate number of human experts to
   analyze the information explosion. In this paper, we present a
   multi-agent framework which works in large-scale scenarios and responds
   in real time. The input for the framework is biometric information
   acquired at a set of locations. The framework aims to point out
   individuals who act according to a suspicious pattern across these
   locations. The framework works in large-scale scenarios. We present two
   scenarios to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework. The goal in
   the first scenario is to point out; individuals who visited a sequence
   of airports, using face recognition algorithms. The goal in the second
   scenario is to point out individuals who called a set of phones, using
   speaker recognition algorithms. Theoretical performance analysis and
   simulation results show a high overall accuracy of our system in
   real-time.

AB Companies and organizations that track moving objects are interested in
   predicting the intended destination of these moving objects. We develop
   a formal model for destination prediction problems where the agent
   (Predictor) predicting a destination may not know anything about the
   route planning mechanism used by another agent (Target) nor does the
   agent have historical information about the target's past movements nor
   do the observations about the agent have to be complete (there may be
   gaps when the target was not seen). We develop axioms that any
   destination probability function should satisfy and then provide a broad
   family of such functions guaranteed to satisfy the axioms. We
   experimentally compare our work with an existing method for destination
   prediction using Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMMs). We found our
   algorithms to be faster than the existing method. Considering prediction
   accuracy we found that, when the Predictor knows the route planning
   algorithm the target is using, the HSMM method is better, but without
   this assumption our algorithm is better.

AB The paths of 2425 individual motorcycle trips made in London were
   analyzed in order to uncover the route choice decisions made by drivers.
   The paths were derived from global positioning system (GPS) data
   collected by a courier company for each of their drivers, using
   algorithms developed for the purpose of this paper. Motorcycle couriers
   were chosen due to the fact that they both know streets very well and
   that they do not rely on the GPS to guide their navigation. Each trace
   was snapped to the underlying road network, and two competing hypotheses
   for route choice decisions were compared: (a) that riders attempt to
   minimize the Manhattan distance between locations and (b) that they
   attempt to minimize the angular distance. In each case, the distance
   actually traveled was compared to the minimum possible either block or
   angular distance through the road network. It is usually believed that
   drivers who know streets well will navigate trips that reduce Manhattan
   distance; however, here it is shown that angularity appears to play ail
   important role in route choice. 63% of trips made took the minimum
   possible angular distance between origin and destination, while 5a.% of
   trips followed the minimum possible block distance. This implies that
   impact of turns on cognitive distance plays an important role in
   decision making, even when a driver has good knowledge of the spatial
   network.

AB Detecting visits to semantically meaningful places is important for many

   algorithm suitable for mobile devices that exploits pervasive
   RF-beacons. By relying on separate mechanisms to detect entrance to and
   departure from a place and buffering overlapping data for subsequent
   visits, it is more robust than the state-of-the-art, especially in
   detecting short visits, places where people are mobile, or where
   inconsistent beacons are prevalent due to interference. We
   experimentally evaluate PlaceSense's effectiveness in discovering
   semantically meaningful places, and compare with other approaches that
   use coordinates or RF-beacon fingerprints. Our results demonstrate that
   PlaceSense correctly discovers 92% (compared to between 28% and 65% for
   previous work) of the visited places and accurately detects their
   entrance and departure times from both real-life and scripted data sets.

   devices that capture images and videos has led to explosive growth of
   multimedia content available everywhere-from personal disks to the Web.
   while digital media capture and upload has become nearly universal with
   newer device technology, there is still a need for better tools and
   technologies to search large collections of multimedia data and to find
   and deliver the right content to a user according to her current needs
   and preferences. A renewed focus on the subjective dimension in the
   multimedia lifecycle, from creation, distribution, to delivery and
   consumption, is required to address this need beyond what is feasible
   today. integration of the subjective aspects of the media itself-its
   affective, perceptual, and physiological potential (both intended and
   achieved), together with those of the users themselves will allow for
   personalizing the content access, beyond today's facility. This
   integration, transforming the traditional multimedia information
   retrieval (MIR) indexes to more effectively answer specific user needs,
   will allow a richer degree of personalization predicated on user
   intention and mode of interaction, relationship to the producer, content
   of the media, and their history and lifestyle. in this paper, we
   identify the challenges in achieving this integration, current
   approaches to interpreting content creation processes, to user modelling
   and profiling, and to personalized content selection, and we detail
   future directions. The structure of the paper is as follows: in Section
   1, we introduce the problem and present some definitions. in Section 11,
   we present a review of the aspects of personalized content and current
   approaches for the same. Section III discusses the problem of obtaining
   metadata that is required for personalized media creation and present
   eMediate as a case study of an integrated media capture environment.
   Section IV presents the MAGIC system as a case study of capturing
   effective descriptive data and putting users first in distributed
   learning delivery. The aspects of modelling the user are presented as a
   case study in using user's personality as a way to personalize summaries
   in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper with a discussion
   on the emerging challenges and the open problems.

AB Because of the large amount of trajectory data produced by mobile
   devices, there is an increasing need for mechanisms to extract knowledge
   from this data. Most existing works have focused on the geometric
   properties of trajectories, but. recently emerged the concept of
   semantic trajectories, in which the background geographic information is
   integrated to trajectory sample points. In this new concept,
   trajectories are observed as a set of stops and moves, where stops are
   the most important parts of the trajectory. Stops and moves have been
   computed by testing the intersections of trajectories with a set of
   geographic objects given by the user. In this paper we present an
   alternative solution with the capability of finding interesting places
   that are not expected by the user. The proposed solution is a
   spatio-temporal clustering method, based on speed, to work with single
   trajectories. We compare the two different approaches with experiments
   on real data and show that the computation of stops using the concept of
   speed can be interesting for several applications.

AB This paper presents a context-aware mobile recommender system, codenamed
   Magitti. Magitti is unique in that it infers user activity from context
   and patterns of user behavior and, without its user having to issue a
   query, automatically generates recommendations for content matching.
   Extensive field studies of leisure time practices in an urban setting
   (Tokyo) motivated the idea, shaped the details of its design and
   provided data describing typical behavior patterns. The paper describes
   the fieldwork, user interface, system components and functionality, and
   an evaluation of the Magitti prototype.

AB People-centric sensor-based applications targeting mobile device users
   offer enormous potential. However, learning inference models in this
   setting is hampered by the lack of labeled training data and appropriate
   feature inputs. Data features that lead to better classification models
   are not available at all devices due to device heterogeneity. Even for
   devices that provide superior data features, models require sufficient
   training data, perhaps manually labeled by users, before they work well.
   We propose opportunistic feature vector merging, and the
   social-network-driven sharing of training data and models between users.
   Model and training data sharing within social circles combine to reduce
   the user effort and time involved in collecting training data to attain
   the maximum classification accuracy possible for a given model, while
   feature vector merging can enable a higher maximum classification
   accuracy by enabling better performing models even for more
   resource-constrained devices. We evaluate our proposed techniques with a
   significant places classifier that infers and tags locations of
   importance to a user based on data gathered from cell phones.

AB Gathering and analyzing location data is an important part of many
   ubiquitous computing applications. The most common way to represent
   location information is to use numerical coordinates, e.g., latitudes
   and longitudes. A problem with this approach is that numerical
   coordinates are usually meaningless to a user and they contrast with the
   way humans refer to locations in daily communication. Instead of using
   coordinates, humans tend to use descriptive statements about their
   location; for example, "I'm home" or "I'm at Starbucks." Locations, to
   which a user can attach meaningful and descriptive semantics, are often
   called places. In this paper we focus on the automatic extraction of
   places from discontinuous GPS measurements. We describe and evaluate a
   non-parametric Bayesian approach for identifying places from this kind
   of data. The main novelty of our approach is that the algorithm is fully
   automated and does not require any parameter tuning. Another novel
   aspect of our algorithm is that it can accurately identify places
   without temporal information. We evaluate our approach using data that
   has been gathered from different users and different geographic areas.
   The traces that we use exhibit different characteristics and contain
   data from daily life as well as from traveling abroad. We also compare
   our algorithm against the popular k-means algorithm. The results
   indicate that our method can accurately identify meaningful places from
   a variety of location traces and that the algorithm is robust against
   noise.
