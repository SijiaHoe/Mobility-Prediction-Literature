AB This paper introduces a place-matching pattern mining approach that
   detects place-matching patterns from raw spatio-temporal GPS
   trajectories using real-world places from OpenStreetMap. The approach
   begins by annotating raw trajectory recordings as either stopping or
   moving. It then groups contiguously stopping entries into so-called stop
   episodes; each of which is then associated with a number of potential
   stop place candidates from the real-world place repository
   OpenStreetMap. As each stop episode may have multiple place candidates,
   the proposed approach uses a Hidden Markov Model to probabilistically
   match each sequence of stop episodes to its most likely sequence of
   visited real-world places. The result of this stop episode formulation
   and place-matching is that the original trajectories are transformed
   into a discrete, greatly simplified, and more semantically meaningful
   sequence of place visitations. This format enables the last step of our
   approach where frequent itemsets and sequential patterns are extracted
   using traditional approaches. Experimental results with real and
   synthetic datasets demonstrate our approach's running time performance,
   robustness to GPS noise, dataset compression, and matching accuracy.
   Additionally, a case study using human trajectories from the real-world
   Geolife dataset reveals many interesting and seemingly real patterns.
   These findings suggest the general validity and applicability of our
   approach as a place-matching trajectory data mining approach. Crown

AB With the development of GPS and the popularity of mobile devices with
   positioning capability, collecting massive amounts of trajectory data is
   feasible and easy. The daily trajectories of moving objects convey a
   concise overview of their behaviors. Different social roles have
   different trajectory patterns. Therefore, we can identify users or
   groups based on similar trajectory patterns by mining implicit life
   patterns. However, most existing daily trajectories mining studies
   mainly focus on the spatial and temporal analysis of raw trajectory data
   but missing the essential semantic information or behaviors. In this
   paper, we propose a novel trajectory semantics calculation method to
   identify groups that have similar behaviors. In our model, we first
   propose a fast and efficient approach for stay regions extraction from
   daily trajectories, then generate semantic trajectories by enriching the
   stay regions with semantic labels. To measure the similarity between
   semantic trajectories, we design a semantic similarity measure model
   based on spatial and temporal similarity factor. Furthermore, a pruning
   strategy is proposed to lighten tedious calculations and comparisons. We
   have conducted extensive experiments on real trajectory dataset of
   Geolife project, and the experimental results show our proposed method
   is both effective and efficient.

AB With the rapid development of internet economy, transparent logistics is
   stepping into a prosperity period with massive transportation data
   generated and collected every day. In this paper, we focus on the
   segmentation of GPS trajectory data generated in logistics
   transportation to analyze the vehicle behaviors and extract business
   affair information according to the vehicle behavior characteristics,
   which is challenging due to the complexity of trajectory data and
   unavailability of road information. We extract the stopping points from
   the trajectory data sequence based on the duration of nonmovement, and
   construct business time window and electronic fence by analyzing the
   driving habits of vehicles. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic
   logic based data segmentation method (PLDSM) which not only helps
   finding all the business points but also assists in inferring the
   business affair categories. An efficient numerical algorithm integrating
   duality theory and Newton's method is proposed to obtain the optimal
   solution. Finally, a practical example is presented to validate the
   effectiveness of PLDSM. The results greatly enrich the data segmentation
   technique and promote the practicability of probabilistic logic. (C)

AB Transport mode detection is an emerging research area in different
   domains such as urban planning, context-aware mobile computing, and
   intelligent transportation systems. Current approaches are mostly
   data-driven, based on machine learning approaches. However, machine
   learning models require substantial training data and cannot explain the
   reasoning procedure. Data-driven approaches also fall short while
   interpreting trajectories where ground truth information is limited.
   Therefore, this paper develops a novel knowledge-based approach for
   interpreting smartphone global positioning system trajectories by
   detecting various transport modes used during travel. The proposed model
   is based on an expert system that can work without any training, based
   solely on expert knowledge. Core is a fuzzy multiple-input
   multiple-output expert system using kinematic and spatial information
   with a well explained fuzzy reasoning scheme through a fuzzy rule base.
   The model can provide alternate predictions with varied certainty
   factors. Different membership function combinations have been evaluated
   in terms of accuracy and ambiguity, and the result demonstrates that the
   model performs best using a Gaussian-Gaussian combination, comparable to
   the existing machine learning approaches.

AB We study multi-attribute trajectories by combining standard trajectories
   (i.e., a sequence of timestamped locations) and descriptive attributes.
   A new form of continuous k nearest neighbor queries is proposed by
   integrating attributes into the evaluation. To enhance the query
   performance, a hybrid and flexible index is developed to manage both
   spatio-temporal data and attribute values. The index includes a 3D
   R-tree and a composite structure which can be popularized to work
   together with any R-tree based index and Grid-based index. We establish
   an efficient mechanism to update the index and define a cost model to
   estimate the I/Os. Query algorithms are proposed, in particular, an
   efficient method to determine the subtrees containing query attributes.
   Using synthetic and real datasets, we carry out comprehensive
   experiments in a prototype database system to evaluate the efficiency,
   scalability and generality. Our approach gains more than an order of
   magnitude speedup compared to three alternative approaches by using 1.8
   millions of trajectories and hundreds of attribute values. The update
   performance is evaluated and the cost model is validated.

AB The ever-increasing volume of trajectories of moving objects and the
   diversity of intelligent transportation systems and location-based
   services that rely on spatio-temporal data of moving objects highlight
   the need for more efficient indexing techniques. The state-of-the-art
   methods index moving objects at three time modes of past (historical
   data), present, and future. An integrated method called "PCI" was
   proposed (past current indexing) to index and store spatial-temporal
   data of the past and present simultaneously. The method can handle
   queries in both the time modes and it processes and generates both the
   past and present indices using an integrated set of processing
   resources. Two interconnected data structures were utilized to store
   indices of' both the time modes. Connecting the index of different time
   modes enforces efficiency challenges due to difference in updating
   costs. Since the method stores the indices in the main memory, the way
   the structures are connected to each other makes it possible to transfer
   the current data to the section responsible for historical data. This
   method indexes them in the trajectory of moving objects at a minimum
   time expense. As the quality of data inevitably affects the performance
   of applications, map matching methods was used in PCI to remove
   noises-e.g., stationary state noises-in the data received from the
   moving objects. This feature adds to the accuracy and reliability of
   query results. The effects of data reduction techniques on accelerating
   indexing, query processing, and reducing memory consumption (in
   voluminous data sets) were examined. Results of the comparisons, made
   based on the experiments, showed the higher efficiency of the indexing
   structure.

AB As users of mobile devices make phone calls, browse the web, or use an
   app, large volumes of data are routinely generated that are a
   potentially useful source for investigating human behavior in space.
   However, as such data are usually collected only as a by-product, they
   often lack stringent experimental design and ground truth, which makes
   interpretation and derivation of valid behavioral conclusions
   challenging. Here, we propose an unsupervised, data-driven approach to
   identify different user types based on high-resolution human movement
   data collected from a smartphone navigation app, in the absence of
   ground truth. We capture spatio-temporal footprints of users,
   characterized by meaningful summary statistics, which are then used in
   an unsupervised step to identify user types. Based on an extensive
   dataset of users of the mobile navigation app Sygic in Australia, we
   show how the proposed methodology allows to identify two distinct groups
   of users: 'travelers', visiting different areas with distinct, salient
   characteristics, and 'locals', covering shorter distances and revisiting
   many of their locations. We verify our approach by relating user types
   to space use: we find that travelers and locals prefer to visit
   distinct, different locations in the Australian cities Sydney and
   Melbourne, as suggested independently by other studies. Although we use
   high-resolution GPS data, the proposed methodology is potentially
   transferable to low-resolution movement data (e.g. Call Detail Records),
   since we rely only on summary statistics.

AB P2P online lending platforms provide services where individuals lend
   money to others without the involvement of traditional financial
   institutions. Due to its convenience, the platforms have gained in
   popularity. However, these platforms may suffer a significant loss if
   they cannot make good loan decisions based on default prediction
   results. In this paper, we aim to support the loan decision on P2P
   platforms based on meta-level phone usage data when the information
   asymmetry exists for mass borrowers. We extract variables from phone
   usage data, and use an empirical study to analyze the relationship
   between these variables and loan default. Then a default prediction
   method is conducted for P2P lending based on the AdaBoost algorithm. The
   data used in this study are from the generalized used mobile phones,
   which make the method applicable to a wide range of users. The empirical
   study shows that phone usage patterns, including telecommunication
   patterns, mobility patterns, and App usage patterns contain predictive
   capability of loan default. The experiments on prediction method
   demonstrate satisfying performance, which suggests the proposed method
   has favorable potential being implemented in real-world P2P lending
   platforms.

AB The popularity of smart mobile devices generated data, e.g., check-ins
   and geo-tagged status, offers new opportunity for better understanding
   human mobility regularity. Existing works on this problem usually resort
   to explicit frequency statistics models, such as association rules and
   sequential patterns, and rely on Euclidean distance to measure the
   spatial dependence. However, the noisiness and uncertainty natures of
   geospatial data hinder these methods' application on human mobility in
   robust and intuitive way. Moreover, the mobility spatial data volume and
   accumulation speed challenge the traditional methods in efficiency,
   scalability, and time-space complexity aspects. In this context, we
   leverage full Bayesian sequential modeling, to revisit mobility
   regularity discovery from high level probabilistic semantic knowledge
   perspective, and to alleviate the inherent in mobility modeling and
   geo-data noisiness induced uncertainty. Specifically, the mobility
   semantics is embodied by virtue of underlying geospatial topics and
   topical transitions of mobility trajectories. A classic variational
   inference is derived to estimate posterior and predictive probabilities,
   and furthermore, the stochastic optimization is utilized to mitigate the
   costly computational overhead in message passing subroutine. The
   experimental results confirm that our approach not only reasonably
   recognizes the geospatial mobility semantic patterns, but also scales up
   well to embrace the massive spatial-temporal human mobility activity
   data.

AB Location-based social networks (LBSN) have provided new possibilities
   for researchers to gain knowledge about human spatiotemporal behavior,
   and to make predictions about how people might behave through space and
   time in the future. An important requirement of successfully utilizing
   LBSN in these regards is a thorough understanding of the respective
   datasets, including their inherent potential as well as their
   limitations. Specifically, when it comes to predictions, we must know
   what we can actually expect from the data, and how we could maximize
   their usefulness. Yet, this knowledge is still largely lacking from the
   literature. Hence, this work explores one particular aspect which is the
   theoretical predictability of LBSN datasets. The uncovered
   predictability is represented with an interval. The lower bound of the
   interval corresponds to the amount of regular behaviors that can easily
   be anticipated, and represents the correct predication rate that any
   algorithm should be able to achieve. The upper bound corresponds to the
   amount of information that is contained in the dataset, and represents
   the maximum correct prediction rate that cannot be exceeded by any
   algorithms. Three Foursquare datasets from three American cities are
   studied as an example. It is found that, within our investigated
   datasets, the lower bound of predictability of the human spatiotemporal
   behavior is 27%, and the upper bound is 92%. Hence, the inherent
   potentials of the dataset for predicting human spatiotemporal behavior
   are clarified, and the revealed interval allows a realistic assessment
   of the quality of predictions and thus of associated algorithms.
   Additionally, in order to provide further insight into the practical use
   of the dataset, the relationship between the predictability and the
   check-in frequencies are investigated from three different perspectives.
   It was found that the individual perspective provides no significant
   correlations between the predictability and the check-in frequency. In
   contrast, the same two quantities are found to be negatively correlated
   from temporal and spatial perspectives. Our study further indicates that
   the heavily frequented contexts and some extraordinary geographic
   features such as airports could be good starting points for effective
   improvements of prediction algorithms. In general, this research
   provides novel knowledge regarding the nature of the LBSN dataset and
   practical insights for a more reasonable utilization of the dataset.

AB User-generated social media data tagged with geographic information
   present messages of dynamic spatio-temporal trajectories. These
   increasing mobility data provide potential opportunities to enhance the
   understanding of human mobility behaviors. Several trajectory data
   mining approaches have been proposed to benefit from these rich
   datasets, but fail to incorporate aspatial semantics in mining. This
   study investigates mining frequent moving sequences of geographic
   entities with transit time from geo-tagged data. Different from previous
   analysis of geographic feature only trajectories, this work focuses on
   extracting patterns with rich context semantics. We extend raw
   geographic trajectories generated from geo-tagged data with rich context
   semantic annotations, use regions-of-interest as stops to represent
   interesting places, enrich them with multiple aspatial semantic
   annotations, and propose a semantic trajectory pattern mining algorithm
   that returns basic and multidimensional semantic trajectory patterns.
   Experimental results demonstrate that semantic trajectory patterns from
   our method present semantically meaningful patterns and display richer
   semantic knowledge.

AB Nowadays, location-based data collected by GPS-equipped devices such as
   smartphones and cars are often stored as spatio-temporal sequences of
   points denoted as trajectories. The analysis of the large generated
   trajectory databases such as the detection of patterns, outliers, and
   stops has a great importance for many application domains. Over the past
   few years, several successful trajectory data infrastructures have been
   progressively developed for a large range of applications in both the
   terrestrial and maritime environments. However, it still appears that
   amongst many research issues to consider, the resulting uncertainties
   when analyzing local trajectory properties have not been completely
   taken into account. In particular, determining for instance certainty
   rates, while detecting stop points, might have valuable impacts on most
   cases. The framework developed in this paper introduces an approach
   based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, and whose objective is
   to detect trajectory stop points and associated degrees of uncertainty.
   The approach is experimented using a large urban trajectory database and
   is compared to several computational algorithms introduced in previous
   studies. The results show that our approach reduces uncertainty values
   when detecting trajectory stop points as well as a significant
   improvement of the recall and precision values.

AB With the advent of online gaming, access to in-game data has become
   increasingly important for players as it provides great opportunities
   for them to reflect and improve upon their gameplay or to compare their
   performance with others. Some of the currently most popular games focus
   on strategy and tactics, requiring players to skillfully position and
   maneuver units in order to achieve victory in battle. However, current
   visualizations for retrospective analysis of battles and that are
   targeted toward players are mainly limited to heatmaps and hence are not
   well suited for conveying the flow of battle. By contrast, military
   planners and historians alike have long used maps to provide a concise
   visual overview of troop movements. In this article, we are proposing an
   algorithm for automatically creating such battle maps from tracked

AB People living in highly populated cities increasingly experience
   decreased quality of life due to pollution and traffic congestion. With
   the objective of reducing the number of circulating vehicles, we
   investigate a novel approach to boost ride-sharing opportunities based
   on the knowledge of the human activities behind individual mobility
   demands. We observe that in many cases the activity motivating the use
   of a private car (e.g., going to a shopping mall) can be performed in
   many different places. Therefore, when there is the possibility of
   sharing a ride, people having a pro-environment behavior or interested
   in saving money can accept to fulfill their needs at an alternative
   destination. We thus propose activity-based ride matching (ABRM), an
   algorithm aimed at matching ride requests with ride offers, possibly
   reaching alternative destinations where the intended activity can he
   performed. By analyzing two large mobility datasets extracted from a
   popular social network, we show that our approach could largely impact
   urban mobility by resulting in an increase up to 54.69% of ride-sharing
   opportunities with respect to a traditional destination-oriented
   approach. Due to the high number of ride possibilities found by ABRM, we
   introduce and assess a subsequent ranking step to provide the user with
   the topk most relevant rides only. We discuss how ABRM parameters affect
   the fraction of car rides that can he saved and how the ranking function
   can be tuned to enforce pro-environment behaviors.

AB We present a framework for the partitioning of a spatial trajectory in a
   sequence of segments based on spatial density and temporal criteria. The
   result is a set of temporally separated clusters interleaved by
   sub-sequences of unclustered points. A major novelty is the proposal of
   an outlier or noise model based on the distinction between intra-cluster
   (local noise) and inter-cluster noise (transition): the local noise
   models the temporary absence from a residence while the transition the
   definitive departure towards a next residence. We analyze in detail the
   properties of the model and present a comprehensive solution for the
   extraction of temporally ordered clusters. The effectiveness of the
   solution is evaluated first qualitatively and next quantitatively by
   contrasting the segmentation with ground truth. The ground truth
   consists of a set of trajectories of labeled points simulating animal
   movement. Moreover, we show that the approach can streamline the
   discovery of additional derived patterns, by presenting a novel
   technique for the analysis of periodic movement. From a methodological
   perspective, a valuable aspect of this research is that it combines the
   theoretical investigation with the application and external validation
   of the segmentation framework. This paves the way to an effective
   deployment of the solution in broad and challenging fields such as
   e-science.

   static medium limits the functions of such maps. To benefit these analog
   maps from location-aware environments, interactivity, and data feedback

   by providing tools to georeference analog maps and integrate multimedia
   sightseeing information owned by local tourism organizations is
   implemented. The processes for analog map georeferencing and content
   integration, as well as the design principles for mobile tourism
   applications, are introduced and discussed in detail. In cooperation
   with college students, university campuses, and local tourism
   organizations, experimental applications were implemented to evaluate
   the functionality and usability of the proposed mobile mapping
   application and the feasibility of the proposed solution. Two published
   applications are introduced briefly, with preliminary analyses using
   data donated by application users, which have shown positive
   contributions to understanding users' behavior and requirements.

AB Human mobility is closely associated with places. Due to advancements in
   GPS devices and related sensor technologies, an unprecedented amount of
   tracking data has been generated in recent years, thus providing a new
   way to investigate the interactions between individuals and places,
   which are vital for depicting individuals' characteristics. In this
   paper, we propose a framework for mining individual similarity based on
   long-term trajectory data. In contrast to most existing studies, which
   have focused on the sequential properties of individuals' visits to
   public places, this paper emphasizes the essential role of the
   spatio-temporal interactions between individuals and their personally
   significant places. Specifically, rather than merely using public
   geographic databases, which include only public places and lack personal
   meanings, we attempt to interpret the semantics of places that are
   significant to individuals from the perspectives of personal behavior.
   Next, we propose a new individual similarity measurement that
   incorporates both the spatio-temporal and semantic properties of
   individuals' visits to significant places. By experimenting on
   real-world GPS datasets, we demonstrate that our approach is more
   capable of distinguishing individuals and characterizing individual
   features than the previous methods. Additionally, we show that our
   approach can be used to effectively measure individual similarity and to
   aggregate individuals into meaningful subgroups.

AB Construction is one of the most hazardous industries because it involves
   dynamic interactions between workers and machinery on sites. The recent
   technological developments in indoor positioning technologies provide a
   huge volume of spatio-temporal data for studying dynamic interactions of
   moving objects. The results from such studies can be used for enhancing
   safety management strategies on sites by recognizing the mobility
   related workers' behaviors. For understanding workers' mobility
   behaviors to improve site safety, a system is proposed based on semantic
   trajectories and the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Firstly, the system
   captures raw spatio-temporal trajectories of workers using an Indoor
   Positioning System (IPS) and preprocess them for determining the
   important stay locations where the workers are spending the majority of
   their time. Then, these processed trajectories are transformed into
   semantic trajectories to establish an understanding of the meanings
   behind workers' mobility behaviors in terms of the building environment.
   Lastly, HMMs along with the Viterbi algorithm are used for categorizing
   different workers' mobility behaviors within the identified stay
   locations. The proposed system is tested using an indoor building
   environment and the results show that it holds a potential to identify
   high-risk workers behaviors to improve site safety.

AB In a more and more urbanized World, the so-called Smart Cities need to
   be driven by the principles of efficiency and sustainability.
   Information and Communications Technologies and, in particular, the
   Internet of Things will play a key role on this, since they will allow
   monitoring and optimizing all the municipal services that exist and
   shall exist. People flow monitoring stands out in this context due to
   its wide range of applications, spanning from monitoring transport
   infrastructure to physical security applications. There are different
   techniques to perform people flow monitoring, presenting pros and cons,
   as in any other engineering problem. Typically, the options that provide
   the most accurate results are also the most expensive ones, whereas
   there are cases where presence detection in given areas is enough and
   cost is a limiting factor. The main goal of this paper is to prove that
   a minimal deployment of sensors, combined with the adequate analysis and
   visualization algorithms, can render useful results. In order to achieve
   this goal, a dataset is used with 1-year data from a real infrastructure
   composed of 9 Wi-Fi tracking sensors deployed in the Telecommunications
   Engineering School of Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, which is
   visited by 4000 people daily and covers 1.8 hectares. The data analysis
   includes time and occupancy, position of people, and identification of
   common behaviors, as well as a comparison of the accuracy of the
   considered solution with actual data and a video monitoring system
   available at the library of the school. The obtained insights can be
   used for optimizing the management and operation of the school, as well
   as for other similar infrastructures and, in general, for other kind of
   applications which require not very accurate people flow monitoring at
   low cost.

AB This paper focuses on modeling and classifying trajectories from video

   features for recognizing and modeling motions of objects. In a training
   phase, a discretization of the proposed features is performed by using a
   self-organizing map approach such that a set of clusters (feature
   vocabulary) is created for describing trajectories. A cluster
   dissimilarity measure based on a weighted fusion of features facilitates
   the recognition of trajectory classes in an incremental way. As a
   result, an unsupervised method for encoding observed motion information
   and identifying trajectory patterns is proposed in this article. The
   method is evaluated with real and simulated data. Additionally,
   comparisons with previous works show the benefits of our method when
   encoding and identifying motion patterns in video sequences.

AB In this research, we match web-based activity diary data with daily

   residents in a 7-day survey in Beijing in 2012 to investigate activity
   satisfaction. Given the complications arising from the irregular time
   intervals of GPS-integrated diary data and the associated complex
   dependency structure, a direct application of standard (spatial) panel
   data econometric approaches is inappropriate. This study develops a
   multi-level temporal autoregressive modelling approach to analyse such
   data, which conceptualises time as continuous and examines sequential
   correlations via a time or space-time weights matrix. Moreover, we
   manage to simultaneously model individual heterogeneity through the
   inclusion of individual random effects, which can be treated flexibly
   either as independent or dependent. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
   (MCMC) algorithms are developed for model implementation. Positive
   sequential correlations and individual heterogeneity effects are both
   found to be statistically significant. Geographical contextual
   characteristics of sites where activities take place are significantly
   associated with daily activity satisfaction, controlling for a range of
   situational characteristics and individual socio-demographic attributes.
   Apart from the conceivable urban planning and development implications
   of our study, we demonstrate a novel statistical methodology for
   analysing semantic GPS trajectory data in general.

AB Travel recommendation systems provide suggestions to the users based on
   different information, such as user preferences, needs, or constraints.
   The recommendation may also take into account some characteristics of
   the points of interest (POIs) to be visited, such as the opening hours,
   or the peak hours. Although a number of studies have been proposed on
   the topic, most of them tailor the recommendation considering the user
   viewpoint, without evaluating the impact of the suggestions on the
   system as a whole. This may lead to oscillatory dynamics, where the
   choices made by the system generate new peak hours.
   This paper considers the trip planning problem that takes into account
   the balancing of users among the different POIs. To this aim, we
   consider the estimate of the level of crowding at POIs, including both
   the historical data and the effects of the recommendation. We formulate
   the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, and we design a
   recommendation engine that explores the solution space in near
   real-time, through a distributed version of the Simulated Annealing
   approach. Through an experimental evaluation on a real dataset, we show
   that our solution is able to provide high quality recommendations, yet
   maintaining that the attractions are not overcrowded.

AB This paper considers the problem of partitioning an individual GPS
   trajectory data into homogeneous, meaningful segments such as stops and
   trips. Signal loss and signal noise are highly prevalent in human
   trajectory data, and it is challenging to deal with uncertainties in
   segmentation algorithms. We propose a new trajectory segmentation
   algorithm that detects stop segments in a noise-robust manner from GPS
   data with time gaps. The algorithm consists of three steps that impute
   time gaps, split data into base segments and estimate states over a base
   segment. The state-dependent path interpolation was proposed as a
   framework for gap imputation to deal with locational and temporal
   uncertainties associated with signal loss. A spatiotemporal
   clustering-based trajectory segmentation was proposed to detect
   spatiotemporal clusters of any shape regardless of density to cut a
   trajectory into internally similar base segments. Fuzzy inference was
   employed to deal with borderline cases in determining states over base
   segments based on input features. The proposed algorithm was applied to
   detect stop/move episodes from raw GPS trajectories that were collected
   from 20 urban and 19 suburban participants. Sensitivity analysis was
   conducted to guide the choice of parameters such as the temporal and
   spatial definitions of a stop. Experimentation results show that the
   proposed method correctly identified 92% of stop/move episodes, and
   correctly estimated 98% of episode duration. This study indicates that a
   sequence of state-dependent gap imputation, clustering-based data
   segmentation and fuzzy-set-based state estimation can satisfactorily
   deal with uncertainty in processing human GPS trajectory data.

   With the advancement of mobile positioning techniques and various

   human mobile trajectories and to derive a large amount of valuable
   information from geospatial big data. Extracting and recognizing
   personally interesting places and predicting next semantic location
   become a research hot spot in LBS. In this paper, we proposed an
   approach to predict next personally semantic place with historical
   visiting patterns derived from mobile device logs. To address the
   problems of location imprecision and lack of semantic information, a
   modified trip-identify method is employed to extract key visit points
   from GPS trajectories to a more accurate extent while semantic
   information are added through stay point detection and semantic places
   recognition. At last, a decision tree model is adopted to explore the
   spatial, temporal, and sequential features in contextual location
   prediction. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, experiments
   were conducted based on a trajectory collection in Guangzhou downtown
   area. The results verified the feasibility of our approach on contextual

AB Large volumes of trajectory-based data require development of

   computational solutions. In particular, identification of meaningful
   geometric points of such trajectories is still an open research issue.
   Detection of these critical points implies to identify
   self-intersecting, turning and curvature points so that specific
   geometric characteristics that are worth identifying could be denoted.
   This research introduces an approach called Trajectory Critical Point
   detection using Convex Hull (TCP-CH) to identify a minimum number of
   critical points. The results can be applied to large trajectory data
   sets in order to reduce storage costs and complexity for further data
   mining and analysis. The main principles of the TCP-CH algorithm include
   computing: convex areas, convex hull curvatures, turning points, and
   intersecting points. The experimental validation applied to Geolife
   trajectory dataset reveals that the proposed framework can identify most
   of intersecting points in reasonable computing time. Finally, comparison
   of the proposed algorithm with other methods, such as turning function
   shows that our approach performs relatively well when considering the
   overall detection quality and computing time.

AB Segmentation techniques partition a sequence of data points into a
   series of disjoint subsequences-segments-based on some criteria.
   Depending on the context and the nature of data themselves, segments
   return an approximate representation. The final result is a summarized
   representation of the sequence. This intuitive mechanism has been
   extensively studied, for example, for the summarization of time series
   in order to preserve the 'shape' of the sequence while omitting
   irrelevant details. This survey focuses on the use of segmentation
   methods for extracting behavioral information from individual mobility
   data, in particular from spatial trajectories. Such information can then
   be given a compact representation in the form of summarized
   trajectories, e.g., semantic trajectories and symbolic trajectories. Two
   major streams of research are discussed, spanning computational geometry
   and data mining respectively, that are emblematic of the multiplicity of
   views. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In current navigation systems quantitative metrics such as distance,
   time and energy are used to determine optimal paths. Yet, a "best path",
   as judged by users, might take qualitative features into account, for
   instance the scenery or the touristic attractiveness of a path. Machines
   are unable to quantify such "soft" properties. Crowdsourced data
   provides us with a means to record user choices and opinions. In this
   work, we survey heterogeneous sources of spatial, spatio-temporal and
   textual crowdsourced data as a proxy for qualitative information of
   users in movement. We (i) explore the process of extracting qualitative
   information from uncertain crowdsourced data sets employing different
   techniques, (ii) investigate the enrichment of road networks with the
   extracted information by adjusting its properties and by building a
   meta-network, and (iii) show how to use the enriched networks for
   routing purposes. An extensive experimental evaluation of our proposed
   methods on real-world data sets shows that qualitative properties as
   captured by crowdsourced data can indeed be used to improve the quality
   of routing suggestions while not sacrificing their quantitative aspects.

AB In transportation studies, one fundamental problem is to analyze the
   departures and arrivals at locations in order to predict the travel
   demands for urban planning and traffic management. These movements can
   relate to many factors, e.g., activity distributions and household
   demographics. This paper presents how we use visualization to explore
   the relationship between people movements and activity distributions
   that are characterized by the points of interest (POIs). To effectively
   model and visualize such relationship, we introduce POI-mobility
   signature, a compact visual representation with two main components. 1)
   A mobility component to present major people movements information
   across temporal dimension. 2) A POI component to present the activity
   context over an area of interest in spatial domain. To derive the
   signature, we study assorted analytical tasks after discussing with
   transportation researchers, consider essential design principles, and
   apply the representation to study a real-world dataset, which is the
   massive public transportation data in Singapore with over 30 million
   trajectories and crowd-sourcing POIs retrieved from Foursquare. Finally,
   we conduct three case studies and interview three transportation experts
   to verify the efficacy of our method.

AB Trajectory pattern mining is becoming increasingly popular because of
   the development of ubiquitous computing technology. Trajectory data
   contain abundant semantic and geographic information that reflects
   people's movement patterns, i.e., who is performing a certain type of
   activity when and where. However, the variety and complexity of people's
   movement activity and the large size of trajectory datasets make it
   difficult to mine valuable trajectory patterns. Moreover, most existing
   trajectory similarity measurements only consider a portion of the
   information contained in trajectory data. The patterns obtained cannot
   be interpreted well in terms of both semantic meaning and geographic
   distributions. As a result, these patterns cannot be used accurately for
   recommendation systems or other applications. This paper introduces a
   novel concept of the semantic-geographic pattern that considers both
   semantic and geographic meaning simultaneously. A flexible density-based
   clustering algorithm with a new trajectory similarity measurement called
   semantic intensity is used to mine these semantic-geographic patterns.
   Comparative experiments on check-in data from the Sina Weibo service
   demonstrate that semantic intensity can effectively measure both
   semantic and geographic similarities among trajectories. The resulting
   patterns are more accurate and easy to interpret.

AB Lately, the amount of mobility data recorded by GPS-enabled (and other)
   devices has increased drastically, entailing the necessity of efficient
   processing and analysis methods. In many cases, not only the geographic
   position, but also additional time-dependent information are traced
   and/or generated, according to the purpose of the evaluation. For
   example, in the field of animal behavior research, besides the position
   of the monitored animal, biologists are interested in further data like
   the altitude or the temperature at every measuring point. Other
   application domains comprise the names of streets, places of interest,
   or transportation modes that can be recorded along with the geographic
   position of a person. In this paper, we present in detail a framework
   for analyzing datasets with arbitrarily many time-dependent attributes.
   This can be considered as a major extension of our previous work, a
   comprehensive framework for pattern matching on symbolic trajectories
   with index support. For an efficient processing of different data types,
   a variable number of indexes of four different types that correspond to
   the data types of the attributes are applied. We demonstrate the
   expressiveness and efficiency of our approach by querying a real dataset
   representing taxi trips in Rome and, particularly, with a broad series
   of experiments using trajectories generated by BerlinMOD combined with
   geological raster data.

AB Data generated on location-based social networks provide rich
   information on the whereabouts of urban dwellers. Specifically, such
   data reveal who spends time where, when, and on what type of activity
   (e.g., shopping at a mall, or dining at a restaurant). That information
   can, in turn, be used to describe city regions in terms of activity that
   takes place therein. For example, the data might reveal that citizens
   visit one region mainly for shopping in the morning, while another for
   dining in the evening. Furthermore, once such a description is
   available, one can ask more elaborate questions. For example, one might
   ask what features distinguish one region from another-some regions might
   be different in terms of the type of venues they host and others in
   terms of the visitors they attract. As another example, one might ask
   which regions are similar across cities. In this paper, we present a
   method to answer such questions using publicly shared Foursquare data.
   Our analysis makes use of a probabilistic model, the features of which
   include the exact location of activity, the users who participate in the
   activity, as well as the time of the day and day of week the activity
   takes place. Compared to previous approaches to similar tasks, our
   probabilistic modeling approach allows us to make minimal assumptions
   about the data-which relieves us from having to set arbitrary parameters
   in our analysis (e.g., regarding the granularity of discovered regions
   or the importance of different features). We demonstrate how the model
   learned with our method can be used to identify the most likely and
   distinctive features of a geographical area, quantify the importance
   features used in the model, and discover similar regions across
   different cities. Finally, we perform an empirical comparison with
   previous work and discuss insights obtained through our findings.

AB Analyzing the spatial behaviors of moving-point objects (MPOs) and
   discovering their movement patterns have been of great interest to the
   geographic information science community recently. These interests can
   be explored through analyzing similarities in the MPO trajectories.
   Because movements of objects take place in various contexts, their
   trajectories are also highly influenced by such contexts. Therefore, it
   is essential to fully understand the contexts and to realize how they
   can be incorporated into movement analysis. This article first proposes
   a taxonomy for contexts. Then, a modified version of dynamic time
   warping called context-based dynamic time warping (CDTW) is introduced,
   to contextually assess the multidimensional weighted similarities of
   trajectories. Ultimately, the results of similarity searches are
   utilized in discovering the relative movement patterns of the MPOs. To
   evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our proposed CDTW method,
   we run several experiments on real datasets that were obtained from
   commercial airplanes in a constrained Euclidean space, taking into
   account contextual information. Specifically, these experiments were
   conducted to explore the role of contexts and their interactions in
   similarity measures of trajectories. The results yielded the robustness
   of CDTW method in quantifying the commonalities of trajectories and
   discovering movement patterns with 80% accuracy. Moreover, the results
   revealed the importance of exploiting contextual information because it
   can enhance and restrict movements.

AB Spatiotemporal data mining studies the field of discovering interesting
   patterns from large spatiotemporal databases. Although these databases
   generate a huge volume of data daily from satellite images and mobile
   sensors like GPS, among these data we find first spatiotemporal and
   geographical data; secondly, the trajectories browsed by moving objects
   in some time intervals. Combination of these types of data leads to
   producing semantic trajectory data. Enriching trajectories with semantic
   geographical information leads to ease queries, analysis, and mining, in
   order to give more meaning to behaviors potentially extracted from
   trajectories. Therefore, applying mining techniques on semantic
   trajectories continue to prove to be a success story in discovering
   useful and nontrivial behavioral patterns of moving objects. The purpose
   of this paper is to make an overview of spatiotemporal knowledge
   discovery (STKD) and techniques recently used to extract knowledge from
   spatiotemporal data based on analysis of recent literature. Then leading
   towards a deeper analysis about semantic trajectory knowledge discovery
   as a specified field from STKD that integrates trajectory sample points
   with geographical data before applying mining techniques in order to
   extract behavioral knowledge from semantic trajectories which can be
   more useful and significant for the application users.

AB Existing data models for moving objects in networks are often limited by
   flexibly controlling the granularity of representing networks and the
   cost of location updates and do not encompass semantic information, such
   as traffic states, traffic restrictions and social relationships. In
   this paper, we aim to fill the gap of traditional network-constrained
   models and propose a hierarchical graph model called the
   Geo-Social-Moving model for moving objects in Networks (GSMNet) that
   adopts four graph structures, RouteGraph, SegmentGraph, ObjectGraph and
   MoveGraph, to represent the underlying networks, trajectories and
   semantic information in an integrated manner. The bulk of user-defined
   data types and corresponding operators is proposed to handle moving
   objects and answer a new class of queries supporting three kinds of
   conditions: spatial, temporal and semantic information. Then, we develop
   a prototype system with the native graph database system Neo4Jto
   implement the proposed GSMNet model. In the experiment, we conduct the
   performance evaluation using simulated trajectories generated from the
   BerlinMOD (Berlin Moving Objects Database) benchmark and compare with
   the mature MOD system Secondo. The results of 17 benchmark queries
   demonstrate that our proposed GSMNet model has strong potential to
   reduce time-consuming table join operations an d shows remarkable
   advantages with regard to representing semantic information and
   controlling the cost of location updates.

AB The increasing use of location-aware devices has led to generate a huge
   volume of data from satellite images and mobile sensors; these data can
   be classified into geographical data. And traces generated by objects
   moving on geographical territory, these traces are usually modeled as
   streams of spatiotemporal points called trajectories. Integrating
   trajectory sample points with geographical and contextual data before
   applying mining techniques can be more gainful for the application
   users. It contributes to produce significant knowledge about movements
   and provide applications with richer and more meaningful patterns.
   Trajectory Outliers are a sort of patterns that can be extracted from
   trajectories. However, the majority of algorithms proposed for
   discovering outliers are based on the geometric side of trajectories;
   our approach extends these works to produce outliers based on semantic
   trajectories in order to give meaning to the outliers extracted, and to
   understand the unusual behaviors that can be detected. To prove the
   efficiency of the approach proposed we show some experimental results.

AB This paper presents a data model to capture moving and changing objects
   in the context of dynamic built environment. Building elements are
   subject to change which represents semantic trajectories crossing
   trajectories of users. These semantic trajectories in dynamics built
   environment permit to capture fine-grained activities and behaviors of
   users and objects. The data model is based on ontology and description
   logics to capture logic constraints on semantic trajectories.

AB As a consequence of the competition between different manufacturers,
   current smartphones improve their features continuously and they
   currently include many sensors. Mobile Workforce Management (MWM) is an
   industrial process that would benefit highly from the information
   captured by the sensors of mobile devices. However, there are some
   problems that prevent MWM software from using this information: (i) the
   abstraction level of the activities currently identified is too low
   (e.g., moving instead of performing an inspection on a client, or
   stopped instead of loading a truck in the facility of a client); (ii)
   research work focuses on using geographic information algorithms on GPS
   data, or machine learning algorithms on sensor data, but there is little
   research on combining both types of data; and (iii) context information
   extracted from geographic information providers or MWM software is
   rarely used. In this paper, we present a new methodology to turn raw
   data collected from the sensors of mobile devices into trajectories
   annotated with semantic activities of a high level of abstraction. The
   methodology is based on activity taxonomies that can be adapted easily
   to the needs of any company. The activity taxonomies describe the
   expected values for each of the variables that are collected in the
   system using predicates defined in a pattern specification language. We
   also present the functional architecture of a module that combines
   context information retrieved from MWM software and geographic
   information providers with data from the sensors of the mobile device of
   the worker to annotate their trajectories and that can be easily
   integrated in MWM systems and in the workflow of any company.
