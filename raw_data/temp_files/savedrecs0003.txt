AB Current advancements in pervasive technologies allow users to create and
   share an increasing amount of whereabouts data. Thus, some rich datasets
   on human mobility are becoming available on the web. In this paper we
   extracted approximately 790,000 mobility traces from a web-based
   repository of GPS tracks-the Nokia Sports Tracker Service. Using data
   mining mechanisms, we show that this data can be analyzed to uncover
   daily routines and interesting schemes in the use of public spaces. We
   first show that our approach supports large-scale analysis of people's
   whereabouts by comparing behavioral patterns across cities. Then, using
   Kernel Density Estimation, we present a mechanism to identify popular
   sport areas in individual cities. This kind of analysis allows us to
   highlight human-centered geographies that can support a wide range of
   applications ranging from location-based services to urban planning. (C)

AB The complement activation product, C5a, is a key factor for regulation
   of inflammatory responses. C5a and C5a(desArg) bind to their receptors,
   C5aR and C5L2, but the functional roles of C5L2 remain controversial. We
   screened the patterns of 23 inflammatory mediators in cultures of
   LPS-activated mouse peritoneal elicited macrophages (PEMs) in the
   presence or absence of recombinant mouse C5a. Production of most
   mediators studied was suppressed by C5a, whereas G-CSF production was
   enhanced. G-CSF gene expression and secretion from PEMs was amplified
   two- to threefold by C5a in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The
   degradation product C5a(desArg) promoted lower levels of G-CSF. The
   effects of C5a on G-CSF were associated with activation of PI3K/Akt and
   MEK1/2 signaling pathways. C5a did not enhance G-CSF production in
   cultures of PEMs from either C5aR- or C5L2-deficient mice, indicating
   that both C5a receptors are indispensable for mediating the effects of
   C5a in the production of G-CSF. Finally, G-CSF levels in plasma during
   polymicrobial sepsis after cecal ligation and puncture were
   substantially lower in C5aR- or C5L2-deficient mice as compared with
   that in C57BL/6J WT mice. These findings elucidate the functional
   characteristics of the C5L2 receptor during the acute inflammatory
   response.

AB With the popularity of positioning devices, Web 2.0 technology, and trip
   sharing services, many users are willing to log and share their trips on
   the Web. Thus, trip planning Web sites are able to provide some new
   services by inferring Regions-Of-Interest (ROIs) and recommending
   popular travel routes from trip trajectories. We argue that simply
   providing some travel routes consisting of popular ROIs to users is not
   sufficient. To tour around a wide geographical area, for example, a
   city, some users may prefer a trip to visit as many ROIs as possible,
   while others may like to stop by only a few ROIs for an in-depth visit.
   We refer to a trip fitting the former user group as an in-breadth trip
   and a trip suitable for the latter user group as an in-depth trip. Prior
   studies on trip planning have focused on mining ROIs and travel routes
   without considering these different preferences. In this article, given
   a spatial range and a user preference of depth/breadth specified by a
   user, we develop a Pattern-Aware Trajectory Search (PATS) framework to
   retrieve the top K trajectories passing through popular ROIs. PATS is
   novel because the returned travel trajectories, discovered from travel
   patterns hidden in trip trajectories, may represent the most valuable
   travel experiences of other travelers fitting the user's trip preference
   in terms of depth or breadth. The PATS framework comprises two
   components: travel behavior exploration and trajectory search. The
   travel behavior exploration component determines a set of ROIs along
   with their attractive scores by considering not only the popularity of
   the ROIs but also the travel sequential relationships among the ROIs. To
   capture the travel sequential relationships among ROIs and to derive
   their attractive scores, a user movement graph is constructed. For the
   trajectory search component of PATS, we formulate two trajectory score
   functions, the depth-trip score function and the breadth-trip score
   function, by taking into account the number of ROIs in a trajectory and
   their attractive scores. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm, namely,
   Bounded Trajectory Search (BTS), to efficiently retrieve the top K
   trajectories based on the two trajectory scores. The PATS framework is
   evaluated by experiments and user studies using a real dataset. The
   experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of
   the proposed PATS framework.

   not been considered together so far. In this paper, we present an
   efficient location-based image retrieval method by conducting the search
   over combined geo-tag and visual-feature spaces. In this retrieval
   method, a cost-based query optimization scheme is proposed to optimize
   the query processing. Different from conventional image retrieval
   methods, our proposed retrieval algorithm combines the above two
   functions as uniform measure. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to
   testify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed retrieval and
   indexing methods respectively.

   information from a number of other tourists. Our proposed mechanism is
   able to predict a set recommended tourism places of elicited rating
   places (e.g., ratings of 1 through 5 stars) for the active tourist
   pre-traveling places. Furthermore, giving restriction of traveling
   factors, such as budge and time, the recommendation system will refine
   the exact set of tourism places by applying genetic algorithm mechanism.
   Finally, the system is based on minimum cost to schedule traveling path

AB In large-scale networks, the structure of the underlying network changes
   frequently, and thus the power iteration method for Personalized
   PageRank computation cannot deal with this kind of dynamic network
   efficiently. In this paper, we design a Monte Carlo-based incremental
   method for Personalized PageRank computation. In a dynamic network,
   first, we do a random walk starting from each node and save the
   performed walks into a fingerprint database; second, we update the
   fingerprint database in a fixed time interval with our proposed update
   algorithm; finally, when a query is issued by a user, we estimate the
   Personalized PageRank vector by our proposed approximation algorithm.
   Experiments on real-world networks show that our method can handle
   multichanges of the underlying network at a time and is more efficient
   than related work, so it can be used in real incremental Personalized
   PageRank-based applications.

   well known that the contextual information is often the key for the
   performances of mobile recommendations. Therefore, in this paper, we
   provide a focused survey of the recent development of context-aware
   mobile recommendations. After briefly reviewing the state-of-the-art of
   recommender systems, we first discuss the general notion of mobile
   context and how the contextual information is collected. Then, we
   introduce the existing approaches to exploit contextual information for
   modeling mobile recommendations. Furthermore, we summarize several
   existing recommendation tasks in the mobile scenarios, such as the
   recommendations in the tourism domain. Finally, we discuss some key
   issues that are still critical in the field of context-aware mobile
   recommendations, including the privacy problem, the energy efficiency
   issues, and the design of user interfaces.

AB Planning travel to unfamiliar regions is a difficult task for novice
   travelers. The burden can be eased if the resident of the area offers to
   help. In this paper, we propose a social itinerary recommendation by
   learning from multiple user-generated digital trails, such as GPS
   trajectories of residents and travel experts. In order to recommend
   satisfying itinerary to users, we present an itinerary model in terms of
   attributes extracted from user-generated GPS trajectories. On top of
   this itinerary model, we present a social itinerary recommendation
   framework to find and rank itinerary candidates. We evaluated the
   efficiency of our recommendation method against baseline algorithms with
   a large set of user-generated GPS trajectories collected from Beijing,
   China. First, systematically generated user queries are used to compare
   the recommendation performance in the algorithmic level. Second, a user
   study involving current residents of Beijing is conducted to compare
   user perception and satisfaction on the recommended itinerary. Third, we
   compare mobile-only approach with Mobile+Cloud architecture for
   practical mobile recommender deployment. Lastly, we discuss
   personalization and adaptation factors in social itinerary
   recommendation throughout the paper.

AB The increasing availability of location-acquisition technologies (GPS,
   GSM networks, etc.) enables people to log the location histories with
   spatio-temporal data. Such real-world location histories imply, to some
   extent, users' interests in places, and bring us opportunities to
   understand the correlation between users and locations. In this article,
   we move towards this direction and report on a personalized friend and
   location recommender for the geographical information systems (GIS) on
   the Web. First, in this recommender system, a particular individual's
   visits to a geospatial region in the real world are used as their
   implicit ratings on that region. Second, we measure the similarity
   between users in terms of their location histories and recommend to each
   user a group of potential friends in a GIS community. Third, we estimate
   an individual's interests in a set of unvisited regions by involving
   his/her location history and those of other users. Some unvisited
   locations that might match their tastes can be recommended to the
   individual. A framework, referred to as a hierarchical-graph-based
   similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed to uniformly model each
   individual's location history, and effectively measure the similarity
   among users. In this framework, we take into account three factors: 1)
   the sequence property of people's outdoor movements, 2) the visited
   popularity of a geospatial region, and 3) the hierarchical property of
   geographic spaces. Further, we incorporated a content-based method into
   a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, which uses HGSM as the
   user similarity measure, to estimate the rating of a user on an item. We
   evaluated this recommender system based on the GPS data collected by 75
   subjects over a period of 1 year in the real world. As a result, HGSM
   outperforms related similarity measures, namely similarity-by-count,
   cosine similarity, and Pearson similarity measures. Moreover, beyond the
   item-based CF method and random recommendations, our system provides
   users with more attractive locations and better user experiences of
   recommendation.
