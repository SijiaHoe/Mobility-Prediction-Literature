AB By leveraging online social networks as an underlying infrastructure,
   Social Participatory Network (SPN) has been becoming a new paradigm of
   participatory sensing systems. However, a significant barrier to the
   widespread use of SPN applications is their vulnerability to various
   forms of malicious attacks. Such threats inhibit human participation and
   thus the viability of SPN systems in everyday use. To solve this
   problem, this paper proposes a trust evaluation framework for
   participants to encourage wider human participation in SPN. The proposal
   is based on the Tianjin University's own existing SPN system, named CRCS
   (ClassRoom Cloud System), which enables participants to use the cloud
   resources for online lessons or library study. It derives the trust
   value of participants by using entropy-weight method and data mining
   algorithms to deal with the behaviors data of participants. Our proposed
   solution can detect malicious participants easily, and more importantly,
   it outperforms other work for its low cost and simple deployment. For
   now, though our solution is based on a specified SPN system, we are
   confident that this solution is highly applicable to most other SPN
   systems.

AB This study focuses on exploiting Call Detail Records (CDR) data in order
   to detect the demand distribution among different zones within the day,
   together with information about the type of activity that characterises
   each zone. Traffic zones are first identified and shaped through a
   k-means clustering analysis. Then, the traffic between different
   clusters is analysed with the aim to identify the type of zone by
   evaluating the traffic calls density for each time period. To evaluate
   the propagation of the demand among the different zones, Markov Chains
   theory is used in order to evaluate the transition matrix among
   different time steps. The developed model enables one to predict CDR
   variations in time and space and, hence, being a proxy for the trip
   distribution. Results point out how these matrices are similar for
   consecutive time intervals; therefore, it is possible to aggregate them
   in an hourly transition matrix, losing a small amount of information
   over the structure of the demand. This also shows that trip distribution
   varies relatively slowly in time and is spatially consistent along the
   days.

AB The needs for cheaper and less intrusive ways to collect activity-travel
   diaries led scientist to pursue new technologies, e.g., positioning
   technologies like GPS. While a fully, reliable and widely accepted
   automatic activity-travel diary collection system is yet to be
   developed, scientists have presented systems that automate parts of an
   activity-travel diary collection. In the advent of automated systems, it
   is important to discuss how to analyse the potential of such systems and
   how to compare different activity-travel diary collection systems. To
   achieve this objective, this paper introduces a parallel survey design
   and a comparison framework for collection systems. The framework can be
   used as a development tool to optimise system design, to report and
   monitor progress of different system designs, to objectively weigh
   benefits in decision making, and to automate systematic analysis. In
   particular, the framework can be used as a comparison tool to reveal the
   qualitative difference in the data gathered using different collection
   systems. To achieve this, the framework defines: 1) a number of
   activity-travel diary measurement entities (trips and triplegs), entity
   attributes (e.g., trip purpose, origin /destination, etc.), 2)
   similarity functions between instances of the same entities, and 3)
   spatial and temporal quality indices to establish a notion of ground
   truth. The utility of the proposed framework is demonstrated by
   analysing the results of a trial survey where data is collected via two
   activity-travel collection systems: a web-based system (PP) and a
   smartphone-app-based system (MEILI). PP was collected for one day period
   and MEILI was used for one week period (with one day overlapping). The
   results show that half of the trips are captured by both systems, while
   each system roughly captures the same number of trips as the other. The
   strengths and weaknesses of MEILI are analysed using the framework on
   the entire week dataset.

AB Tracking travel patterns and modes is useful on many levels. Prior
   efforts to collect this information have been stymied by low accuracies
   or reliance on supplementary devices. One technique to overcome low
   accuracies is to use prompted recall, in which the user is prompted to
   supply the ground truth for automatically generated information.
   However, prompted recall increases the burden on the user, which could
   lead to low adoption or high drop out rates. Using techniques from
   behavioral economics, and prompting directly on the smartphone can
   reduce user burden, and also increase engagement for ongoing data
   collection. In this paper, we describe a system that improves accuracy
   by using behavioral techniques for prompted recall on the smartphone,
   and aggregates the information to help detect large scale patterns. We
   also present the evaluation of a prototype implementation that was used
   to collect data from 44 unpaid volunteers in the San Francisco Bay Area
   over 3 months and compute their transportation carbon footprint.

AB Trajectory data analysis has recently become an active research area.
   This is due to the large availability of mobile tracking sensors, such
   as GPS-enabled smart phones. However, those GPS trackers only provide
   raw trajectories (x, y, t), ignoring information about the activity,
   transportation mode, etc. This information can contribute in producing
   significant knowledge about movements, which transforms raw trajectories
   into semantic trajectories. Therefore, research lately has focused on
   semantic trajectories; their representation, construction, and
   applications. This paper investigates the current studies on semantic
   trajectories so far. We propose a new classification schema for the
   research efforts in semantic trajectory construction and applications.
   The proposed classification schema includes three main classes: semantic
   trajectory modeling, computation, and applications. Besides, we discuss
   the current research gaps found in this research area.

AB Transportation mode detection (TMD) is a growing field of research, in
   which a variety of methods have been developed, foremost for outdoor
   travels. It has been employed in application areas such as public
   transportation and environmental footprint profiling. For indoor travels
   the problem of TMD has received comparatively little attention, even
   though diverse transportation modes, such as biking and electric
   vehicles, are used indoors. The potential applications are diverse, and
   include scheduling and progress tracking for mobile workers, and
   management of vehicular resources. However, for indoor TMD, the physical
   environment as well as the availability and reliability of sensing
   resources differ drastically from outdoor scenarios. Therefore, many of
   the methods developed for outdoor TMD cannot be easily and reliably
   applied indoors.
   In this paper, we explore indoor transportation scenarios to arrive at a
   conceptual model of indoor transportation modes, and then compare
   challenges for outdoor and indoor TMD. In addition, we explore methods
   for TMD we deem suitable in indoor settings, and we perform an extensive
   real-world evaluation of such methods at a large hospital complex. The
   evaluation utilizes Wi-Fi and accelerometer data collected through
   smartphones carried by hospital workers throughout four days of work
   routines. The results show that the methods can distinguish between six
   common modes of transportation used by the hospital workers with an
   F-score of 84.2%.

AB GPS Data from vehicles making trips on the highway are a valuable source

   algorithm for segmenting the highway network into homogenous stretches
   in terms of vehicle speed profiles. We have GPS data of trucks plying
   across India, transmitted at an interval of 10 minutes, for thousands of
   trips. We identify break-points for individual trips and then cluster
   those break-points to obtain highway segment ends. We calculate the
   average velocity of vehicles traversing the regions between these
   segment ends, i.e. the highway segments. Then we merge the segments
   using an iterative minimum difference merging algorithm. The segments
   obtained thus are meaningful and may be utilized in optimal trip
   planning, infrastructure management and other decision making tasks.

AB The GPS-based travel survey is an emerging data collection method in
   transportation planning. The survey's application in trip mode detection
   has been explored in many studies. Most research on trip mode detection
   methods based on GPS data has been developed and tested with data
   collected from European and American countries. The methods cannot be
   easily adapted to Asian countries such as China, India, and Japan, which
   have much higher population densities, more complex road networks, and
   highly mixed travel modes during daily commuting. Furthermore, for trip
   segment division in multimode travel, existing algorithms use travel
   time and distance thresholds that are highly dependent on local travel
   behavior and lack universality across traffic environments This paper
   proposes an innovative framework for detecting trip modes in complex
   urban environments. First, a smartphone application, GPSurvey, was
   developed to collect passive GPS trace data. Then a wavelet transform
   modulus maximum algorithm was developed for trip segment division. The
   algorithm has outstanding capabilities for identifying singularity
   features of a signal; this factor suits the task of detecting mode
   changes in a complex traffic environment. A neural network module was
   developed for mode detection on the basis of cell phone GPS location and
   acceleration data. The results indicate that the proposed method has
   promising performance. The average absolute detection error of mode
   transfer time was within 1 min, and the accuracy for detecting all modes
   was greater than 85%.

AB Recommendation systems are specialized in offering suggestions about
   specific items of different types (e.g., books, movies, restaurants, and
   hotels) that could be interesting for the user. They have attracted
   considerable research attention due to their benefits and also their
   commercial interest. Particularly, in recent years, the concept of
   context-aware recommendation system has appeared to emphasize the
   importance of considering the context of the situations in which the
   user is involved in order to provide more accurate recommendations. The
   detection of the context requires the use of sensors of different types,
   which measure different context variables. Despite the relevant role
   played by sensors in the development of context-aware recommendation
   systems, sensors and recommendation approaches are two fields usually
   studied independently. In this paper, we provide a survey on the use of
   sensors for recommendation systems. Our contribution can be seen from a
   double perspective. On the one hand, we overview existing techniques
   used to detect context factors that could be relevant for
   recommendation. On the other hand, we illustrate the interest of sensors
   by considering different recommendation use cases and scenarios.

AB Several techniques aim to classify human activity using data from

   inferring transportation modes as car, bus, walk, and bike. Despite some
   techniques show improvements in accuracy, researchers constantly deal
   with issues such as over-segmentation and low precision in trip
   reporting. Journeys are over-segmented due to the ambiguous situations,
   for instance: traffic lights, traffic jam, bus stops and weak signal
   reception. Thereby, current techniques report high mis-classification
   errors. We present a method for detecting changes of transportation mode
   on a multimodal journey, where the input data regard to the
   classification of human activities. We use a space transformation for
   extracting features that identify a transition between two
   transportation modes. The data are collected from the Google API for
   Human Activity Classification through a crowdsourcing-based application
   for smartphones. Results show improvements on precision and accuracy in
   comparison to initial classification data outcomes. Therefore, our
   approach reduces the over-segmentation for multimodal journeys.

AB Bandwidth is an extremely valuable and scarce resource in wireless
   networks. Therefore, efficient bandwidth management is necessary to
   support service continuity, guarantee acceptable quality of service and
   ensure steady quality of experience for users of mobile multimedia
   streaming services. Indeed, the support of uniform streaming rate during
   the entire course of a streaming service, whereas the user is on the
   move is a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a framework,
   together with schemes, which integrates user mobility prediction models
   with bandwidth availability prediction models to support the
   requirements of mobile multimedia services. More specifically, we
   propose schemes that predict paths to destinations, times when users
   will enter/exit cells along predicted paths, and available bandwidth in
   cells along predicted paths. With these predictions, a request for a
   mobile streaming service is accepted only when there is enough
   (predicted) available bandwidth, which is along the path to destination,
   to support the service. Simulation results show that the proposed
   approach outperforms existing bandwidth management schemes in better
   supporting mobile multimedia services.

AB Transportation activity surveys collect the travel behavior of people,
   including when, where, and how they travel for urban planning purposes.
   Traditionally, transportation activity surveys are carried out using
   conventional questionaires, which are labor intensive and error prone.
   In this paper, we have developed a smartphone-based mobility sensing
   system, called UrbanMobilitySense, which captures human mobility
   information automatically to conduct transportation activity surveys.
   The UrbanMobilitySense system was designed to address two critical
   issues: 1) energy conservation and 2) privacy preservation. To optimize
   the energy utilization of smartphone, we avoid using the GPS sensor when
   the user is at long-stay places and filter out redundant data before
   data uploading. To preserve personal privacy, each smartphone maintains
   the user's long-stay places by two separate profiles: 1) private place
   profile and 2) public place profile. The former maintains the
   privacy-preserved places (e. g., home), whereas the latter maintains the
   public places (e. g., parks). We implement the UrbanMobilitySense system
   to conduct real-world transportation activity surveys, study the
   performance of our system through extensive experiments, and analyze the
   computational complexity of the proposed algorithms. The outcome of our
   work has been deployed in Singapore to support the Land Transport
   Authority's transportation activity surveys.

AB This paper presented the measurement results of space charge
   distribution and high field conduction in cross-linked polyethylene
   (XLPE) plate sample at various electric fields for a broad temperature
   range from 30 to 90 degrees C. The temperature effect on charge trapping
   and transport mechanism is discussed based on estimation of threshold
   characteristic and apparent mobility. It is shown that the threshold
   field for space charge accumulation apparently decreased with the
   temperature, probably associated with acceleration of charge injection
   and ionic dissociation. The apparent mobility of charges showed an
   exponential dependence on temperature, which indicates enhancement of
   charge detrapping and transfer rate at higher temperature. The field
   dependence of the space charge decreases with the temperature, results
   in more space charge accumulate at room temperature than at high
   temperature at certain high field. This behavior indicates that the
   space charge formation rate increases slower than the charge detrapping
   rate as the temperature increases. Besides, negative charge is always
   dominant in the sample at the measuring field and temperature range.
   This is probably due to stronger electron injection at XLPE-aluminum
   interface or more negative ion formed by dissociation of chemical
   species.

AB Urbanization's rapid progress has modernized many people's lives but
   also engendered big issues, such as traffic congestion, energy
   consumption, and pollution. Urban computing aims to tackle these issues
   by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow,
   human mobility, and geographical data). Urban computing connects urban
   sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a
   recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of
   people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban
   computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet
   conventional city-related fields, like transportation, civil
   engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology in the context
   of urban spaces. This article first introduces the concept of urban
   computing, discussing its general framework and key challenges from the
   perspective of computer sciences. Second, we classify the applications
   of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning,
   transportation, the environment, energy, social, economy, and public
   safety and security, presenting representative scenarios in each
   category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed
   in urban computing into four folds, which are about urban sensing, urban
   data management, knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data, and urban
   data visualization. Finally, we give an outlook on the future of urban
   computing, suggesting a few research topics that are somehow missing in
   the community.

AB With the help of various positioning tools, individuals' mobility
   behaviors are being continuously captured from mobile phones, wireless
   networking devices and GPS appliances. These mobility data serve as an
   important foundation for understanding individuals' mobility behaviors.
   For instance, recent studies show that, despite the dissimilarity in the
   mobility areas covered by individuals, there is high regularity in the
   human mobility behaviors, suggesting that most individuals follow a
   simple and reproducible pattern. This survey paper reviews relevant
   results on uncovering mobility patterns from GPS datasets. Specially, it
   covers the results about inferring locations of significance for
   prediction of future moves, detecting modes of transport, mining
   trajectory patterns and recognizing locationbased activities. The survey
   provides a general perspective for studies on the issues of individuals'
   mobility by reviewing the methods and algorithms in detail and comparing
   the existing results on the same issues. Several new and emergent issues
   concerning individuals' mobility are proposed for further research. (C)

AB The location-based social networks have been becoming flourishing in
   recent years. In this paper, we aim to estimate the similarity between
   users according to their physical location histories (represented by GPS
   trajectories). This similarity can be regarded as a potential social tie
   between users, thereby enabling friend and location recommendations.
   Different from previous work using social structures or directly
   matching users' physical locations, this approach model a user's GPS
   trajectories with a semantic location history (SLH), e.g., shopping
   malls -> restaurants -> cinemas. Then, we measure the similarity between
   different users' SLHs by using our maximal travel match (MTM) algorithm.
   The advantage of our approach lies in two aspects. First, SLH carries
   more semantic meanings of a user's interests beyond low-level geographic
   positions. Second, our approach can estimate the similarity between two
   users without overlaps in the geographic spaces, e.g., people living in
   different cities. When matching SLHs, we consider the sequential
   property, the granularity and the popularity of semantic locations. We
   evaluate our method based on a real-world GPS dataset collected by 109
   users in a period of 1 year. The results show that SLH outperforms a
   physicallocation-based approach and MTM is more effective than several
   widely used sequence matching approaches given this application
   scenario.

AB A novel method for separating trip periods from non-trip periods, called
   a "trip-separation method" hereafter, is proposed. Previous studies on
   such automatic "trip separation" use a fixed threshold to detect "stay
   periods" (i.e., periods in which a subject is staying put) and separate
   them from trip periods. However, this separation procedure does not
   always work well because the collected GPS-positioning data can
   fluctuate according to the surrounding environment even when the subject
   stays within an area. The proposed method dynamically adjusts parameters
   for detecting stay periods according to the surrounding environment. The
   experimental evaluation on the method showed precision of 81%. This is a
   promising result implying that sensor-based travel-behavior surveys are
   possible by utilizing the proposed smartphone-based method.

AB In geographic information science, a plethora of different approaches
   and methods is used to assess the similarity of movement. Some of these
   approaches term two moving objects similar if they share akin paths.
   Others require objects to move at similar speed and yet others consider
   movement similar if it occurs at the same time. We believe that a
   structured and comprehensive classification of movement comparison
   measures is missing. We argue that such a classification not only
   depicts the status quo of qualitative and quantitative movement
   analysis, but also allows for identifying those aspects of movement for
   which similarity measures are scarce or entirely missing.
   In this review paper we, first, decompose movement into its spatial,
   temporal, and spatiotemporal movement parameters. A movement parameter
   is a physical quantity of movement, such as speed, spatial path, or
   temporal duration. For each of these parameters we then review
   qualitative and quantitative methods of how to compare movement. Thus,
   we provide a systematic and comprehensive classification of different
   movement similarity measures used in geographic information science.
   This classification is a valuable first step toward a GIS toolbox
   comprising all relevant movement comparison methods.

   risk of the road section was estimated from the constructed road

AB Remote sensing images are widely used in various fields. However, they
   usually suffer from the poor contrast caused by haze. In this letter, we
   propose a simple, but effective, way to eliminate the haze effect on
   remote sensing images. Our work is based on the dark channel prior and a
   common haze imaging model. In order to eliminate halo artifacts, we use
   a low-pass Gaussian filter to refine the coarse estimated atmospheric
   veil. We then redefine the transmission, with the aim of preventing the
   color distortion of the recovered images. The main advantage of the
   proposed algorithm is its fast speed, while it can also achieve good
   results. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm
   produces visually appealing dehazing images and retains the very fine
   details. Moreover, for images containing partly clear and partly hazy
   areas, our algorithm can also achieve good results.

   survey system that investigates when, where and how people travel in an
   urban area. In such a system, the essential requirement is collecting
   and processing big data which will raise two critical issues,
   energy-conservation and scalability. To address the former issue, the
   GPS sleeping interval of a smart phone is controlled by the back-end
   servers adaptively based on the real-time moving speed and
   transportation modes. To address the latter issue, we consider MapReduce
   to design the back-end Cloud, where intelligent learning and
   classification algorithms are implemented to detect the stops and
   transportation modes and provide smartphones with an appropriate GPS
   sleeping interval based on the GPS statistics on the back-end Cloud. The
   unique feature of our system is to integrate participatory sensing and
   Cloud-enabled processing system closely which incorporates knowledge
   extracted from the Cloud (i.e., transportation modes) into sensing
   control of smartphones. In this way, sensing control could be optimized
   through the knowledge behind crowdsourced data. Our system has been
   deployed in Singapore to support the Land Transport Authority's
   transportation activity survey over 1 year. Extensive experimental
   results indicate that our system can reduce the energy consumption of
   smartphones efficiently and process concurrent data arrival from a huge

AB In the era of ubiquitous computing, a great amount of location data is
   recorded by a wide variety of devices like GPS trackers or smartphones.
   The available datasets are proven to be very good ground for data mining
   and information extraction in general. Since the raw data usually
   carries a huge rate of redundancy, the first step of the process is to
   reduce dataset size. Our research focuses on mining valuable information
   from GPS tracklogs on smartphones, which environment is well known to be
   extremely sensitive to resource-demanding operations, therefore it is
   crucial to reduce input data size as much as possible. In this paper we
   introduce a heading-based filtering method, which is able to drastically
   decrease the number of GPS points needed to represent a trajectory. We
   evaluate and test it by simulations on a real-world dataset, Geolife
   Trajectories. We show that using this filter, data is reduced to an
   average of 39 percent of the original size per trajectory, which causes
   a 250% speedup in the total runtime of Douglas-Peucker line
   generalization algorithm.

   holistic view on the implementation and development of knowledge sharing
   (KS) in patient referral services in Chinese healthcare organisations.
   Overall, 948 articles were retrieved from three major Chinese academic
   databases, namely, CNKI, Wanfang, and CQVIP. After initial review, 97
   articles were included for analysis. The analysis of literature was led
   by four research questions. (1) How well KS is performed in the current
   practice? (2) What are the knowledge flow processes? (3) What are the
   communication channels and how effective they are? (4) What are the
   problems and barriers to KS? The analysis revealed that, despite clear
   political requirement and evident practical needs, KS is in truth
   largely neglected. Moreover, the review informs that the lack of KS is
   resulted by an absence of unified and clearly defined knowledge flow
   processes and pathway and by ineffective communication channels in use.
   In addition, the review findings point to six KS barriers. This paper is
   of interests to healthcare managers, as well as KS practitioners and
   researchers. Also, this paper provides a perspective on KS development
   in the Chinese healthcare services.

AB Determining the mode of transport of an individual is an important

   differentiating between different forms of motorized transport such as
   car, bus, subway etc. Our approach uses location information and
   features derived from transit route information (schedule information,
   not real-time) published by transit agencies. This enables no up-front
   training or learning of routes and can be deployed instantly to a new
   place since most transit agencies publish this information. Combined
   with motion detection using phone accelerometers, we obtain a
   classification accuracy of around 90% on 50+ hours of car and transit
   data.

AB Today, people have the opportunity to opt-in to usage-based automotive
   insurances for reduced premiums by allowing companies to monitor their
   driving behavior. Several companies claim to measure only speed data to
   preserve privacy. With our elastic pathing algorithm, we show that
   drivers can be tracked by merely collecting their speed data and knowing
   their home location, which insurance companies do, with an accuracy that
   constitutes privacy intrusion. To demonstrate the algorithm's real-world
   applicability, we evaluated its performance with datasets from central
   New Jersey and Seattle, Washington, representing suburban and urban
   areas. Our algorithm predicted destinations with error within 250 meters
   for 14% traces and within 500 meters for 24% traces in the New Jersey
   dataset (254 traces). For the Seattle dataset (691 traces), we similarly
   predicted destinations with error within 250 and 500 meters for 13% and
   26% of the traces respectively. Our work shows that these insurance
   schemes enable a substantial breach of privacy.

   parts of Location-Based Social Networks, has been attached with great
   attention. Through reflecting users' real offline life mode, it can
   explore the law behind the check-in behavior, which will help merchants
   better realize marketing precision and consumers get more high quality
   services at the same time. This paper collected check-in data in 6
   months from one of China's largest social networks by using a crawler.
   It also designed a useful and effective Max Matching Algorithm, which
   creatively recognized check-in records so as to match these locations
   with POIs in POI Semantic Hierarchy Model, since users name the
   locations by themselves at will. Finally, a Check-in Behavior
   Information Model for each user could be constructed. On this basis, the
   paper analyzed users' empirical check-in data making using relevant
   statistics technology, such as descriptive statistics and cluster
   analysis, and studied the individual's main geographical activity areas
   and check-in POI types, Chinese users' regularity of check-in time
   distribution, all user's Significant Scores, and the dependent
   relationship between User Experience and POI Interest, in order to
   reveal the underlying user life mode and find out the frequency of
   check-in behavior. This paper hopes to find out active users and hot
   merchants to realize merchants ranking recommendation and loyal and
   potential consumers searching, and help local merchants improve the
   precision of marketing and provide better services for customs.

AB Mobile and pervasive computing technologies enable us to obtain
   real-world sensing data for sociological studies, such as exploring
   human behaviors and relationships. In this paper, we present a study of
   understanding social relationship evolution by using real-life
   anonymized mobile phone data. First, we define a friendship as a
   directed relation, i.e., person A regards another person B as his or her
   friend but not necessarily vice versa. Second, we recognize human
   friendship from a supervised learning perspective. The Support Vector
   Machine (SVM) approach is adopted as the inference model to predict
   friendship based on a variety of features extracted from the mobile
   phone data, including proximity, outgoing calls, outgoing text messages,
   incoming calls, and incoming text messages. Third, we demonstrate the
   social relation evolution process by using the social balance theory.
   For the friendship prediction, we achieved an overall recognition rate
   of 97.0 % by number and a class average accuracy of 89.8 %. This shows
   that social relationships (not only reciprocal friends and non-friends,
   but non-reciprocal friends) can be likely predicted by using real-world
   sensing data. With respect to the friendship evolution, we verified that
   the principles of reciprocality and transitivity play an important role
   in social relation evolution.

AB Focus on movement data has increased as a consequence of the larger

   techniques. In parallel, interest in movement has shifted from raw
   movement data analysis to more application-oriented ways of analyzing
   segments of movement suitable for the specific purposes of the
   application. This trend has promoted semantically rich trajectories,
   rather than raw movement, as the core object of interest in mobility
   studies. This survey provides the definitions of the basic concepts
   about mobility data, an analysis of the issues in mobility
   datamanagement, and a survey of the approaches and techniques for: (i)
   constructing trajectories from movement tracks, (ii) enriching
   trajectories with semantic information to enable the desired
   interpretations of movements, and (iii) using data mining to analyze
   semantic trajectories and extract knowledge about their characteristics,
   in particular the behavioral patterns of the moving objects. Last but
   not least, the article surveys the new privacy issues that arise due to
   the semantic aspects of trajectories.

AB Individual human travel patterns captured by mobile phone data have been
   quantitatively characterized by mathematical models, but the underlying
   activities which initiate the movement are still in a less-explored
   stage. As a result of the nature of how activity and related travel
   decisions are made in daily life, human activity-travel behavior
   exhibits a high degree of spatial and temporal regularities as well as
   sequential ordering. In this study, we investigate to what extent the
   behavioral routines could reveal the activities being performed at
   mobile phone call locations that are captured when users initiate or
   receive a voice call or message.
   Our exploration consists of four steps. First, we define a set of
   comprehensive temporal variables characterizing each call location.
   Feature selection techniques are then applied to choose the most
   effective variables in the second step. Next, a set of state-of-the-art
   machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines, Logistic
   Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests are employed to build
   classification models. Alongside, an ensemble of the results of the
   above models is also tested. Finally, the inference performance is
   further enhanced by a post-processing algorithm.
   Using data collected from natural mobile phone communication patterns of
   80 users over a period of more than one year, we evaluated our approach
   via a set of extensive experiments. Based on the ensemble of the models,
   we achieved prediction accuracy of 69.7%. Furthermore, using the post
   processing algorithm, the performance obtained a 7.6% improvement. The
   experiment results demonstrate the potential to annotate mobile phone
   locations based on the integration of data mining techniques with the
   characteristics of underlying activity-travel behavior, contributing
   towards the semantic comprehension and further application of the
   massive data. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the large-scale adoption of GPS equipped mobile sensing devices,
   positional data generated by moving objects (e.g., vehicles, people,
   animals) are being easily collected. Such data are typically modeled as
   streams of spatio-temporal (x,y,t) points, called trajectories. In
   recent years trajectory management research has progressed significantly
   towards efficient storage and indexing techniques, as well as suitable
   knowledge discovery. These works focused on the geometric aspect of the
   raw mobility data. We are now witnessing a growing demand in several
   application sectors (e.g., from shipment tracking to geo-social
   networks) on understanding the semantic behavior of moving objects.
   Semantic behavior refers to the use of semantic abstractions of the raw
   mobility data, including not only geometric patterns but also knowledge
   extracted jointly from the mobility data and the underlying geographic
   and application domains information. The core contribution of this
   article lies in a semantic model and a computation and annotation
   platform for developing a semantic approach that progressively
   transforms the raw mobility data into semantic trajectories enriched
   with segmentations and annotations. We also analyze a number of
   experiments we did with semantic trajectories in different domains.

AB The knowledge of the transportation mode used by humans (e.g. bicycle,
   on foot, car and train) is critical for travel behaviour research,
   transport planning and traffic management. Nowadays, new technologies
   such as the Global Positioning System have replaced traditional survey
   methods (paper diaries, telephone) because they are more accurate and
   problems such as under reporting are avoided. However, although the
   movement data collected (timestamped positions in digital form) have
   generally high accuracy, they do not contain the transportation mode. We
   present in this article a new method for segmenting movement data into
   single-mode segments and for classifying them according to the
   transportation mode used. Our fully automatic method differs from
   previous attempts for five reasons: (1) it relies on fuzzy concepts
   found in expert systems, that is membership functions and certainty
   factors; (2) it uses OpenStreetMap data to help the segmentation and
   classification process; (3) we can distinguish between 10 transportation
   modes (including between tram, bus and car) and propose a hierarchy; (4)
   it handles data with signal shortages and noise, and other real-life
   situations; (5) in our implementation, there is a separation between the
   reasoning and the knowledge, so that users can easily modify the
   parameters used and add new transportation modes. We have implemented
   the method and tested it with a 17-million point data set collected in
   the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. The accuracy of the
   classification with the developed prototype, determined with the
   comparison of the classified results with the reference data derived
   from manual classification, is 91.6%.

AB Because of the rapid development of technology, larger data sets on
   activity travel behavior have become available. These data sets often
   lack semantic interpretation. This lack of interpretation implies that
   annotation of activity type and transportation mode is necessary. This
   paper aims to infer activity types from Global Positioning System (GPS)
   traces by developing a decision tree based model. The model considers
   only activity start times and activity durations. On the basis of the
   decision tree classification, a probability distribution and a point
   prediction model were constructed. The probability matrix described the
   probability of each activity type for each class (i.e., combination of
   activity start time and activity duration). In each class, the point
   prediction model selected the activity type that had the highest
   probability. Two types of data were collected in 2006 and 2007 in
   Flanders, Belgium (i.e., activity travel data and GPS data). The optimal
   classification tree constructed contained 18 leaves. Consequently, 18 if
   then rules were derived. An accuracy of 74% was achieved when the tree
   was trained. The accuracy of the model for the validation set (72.5%)
   showed that overfitting was minimal. When the model was applied to the
   test set, the accuracy was almost 76%. The models indicated the
   importance of time information in the semantic enrichment process. This
   study contributes to future data collection in that it enables
   researchers to infer activity types directly from activity start time
   and duration information obtained from GPS data. Because no location
   information is needed, this research can be easily and readily applied
   to millions of individual agents.

AB Moving objects databases should be able to manage trips that pass
   through several real world environments, e.g., road network, indoor.
   However, the current data models only deal with the movement in one
   situation and cannot represent comprehensive trips for humans who can
   move inside a building, walk on the pavement, drive on the road, take
   the public vehicles (bus or train), etc. As a result, existing queries
   are solely limited to one environment. In this paper, we design a data
   model that is able to represent moving objects in multiple environments
   in order to support novel queries on trips in different surroundings and
   various transportation modes (e.g., Car, Walk, Bus). A generic and
   precise location representation is proposed that can apply in all
   environments. The idea is to let the space for moving objects be covered
   by a set of so-called infrastructures each of which corresponds to an
   environment and defines the available places for moving objects. Then,
   the location is represented by referencing to the infrastructure. We
   formulate the concept of space and infrastructure and propose the
   methodology to represent moving objects in different environments with
   the integration of precise transportation modes. Due to different
   infrastructure characteristics, a set of novel data types is defined to
   represent infrastructure components. To efficiently support new queries,
   we design a group of operators to access the data. We present how such a
   data model is implemented in a database system and report the
   experimental results. The new model is designed with attention to the
   data models of previous work for free space and road networks to have a
   consistent type system and framework of operators. In this way, a
   powerful set of generic query operations is available for querying,
   together with those dealing with infrastructures and transportation
   modes. We demonstrate these capabilities by formulating a set of
   sophisticated queries across all infrastructures.

AB Travel modes are one of the crucial pieces of information to
   characterize one's travel behavior. In recent years several approaches
   of mode detection from GPS data have been proposed. The approach
   presented in this paper uses machine learning to evaluate a set of
   GPS-based features for their ability to recognize the common modes walk,
   bicycle, car, bus, and train. The proposed features describe motion
   characteristics from GPS-trajectories by relative frequencies. Compared
   to previous work the proposed feature set leads to higher average
   recognition rates around 92% without relying on additional GIS or
   real-time information. The evaluation compares detection rates from
   multilayer perceptrons, logistic model trees, and C4.5 decision trees
   and is complemented by an evolutionary feature selection for selecting
   the most beneficial feature subsets leading to the best quality gain. In
   contrast to other research, this study uses a comparatively large set of
   400 GPS trajectories which have been recorded in rural and urban
   European areas. Results contribute to a higher reliability as well as a
   broader applicability of GPS-only travel mode detection.

AB Understanding travel behaviour and travel demand is of constant
   importance to transportation communities and agencies in every country.
   Nowadays, attempts have been made to automatically infer transportation
   modes from positional data, such as the data collected by using GPS
   devices so that the cost in time and budget of conventional travel diary
   survey could be significantly reduced. Some limitations, however, exist
   in the literature, in aspects of data collection (sample size selected,
   duration of study, granularity of data), selection of variables (or
   combination of variables), and method of inference (the number of
   transportation modes to be used in the learning). This paper therefore,
   attempts to fully understand these aspects in the process of inference.
   We aim to solve a classification problem of GPS data into different
   transportation modes (car, walk, cycle, underground, train and bus). We
   first study the variables that could contribute positively to this
   classification, and statistically quantify their discriminatory power.
   We then introduce a novel approach to carry out this inference using a
   framework based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classification. The
   framework was tested using coarse-grained GPS data, which has been
   avoided in previous studies, achieving a promising accuracy of 88% with
   a Kappa statistic reflecting almost perfect agreement. (C) 2012 Elsevier

AB Planning travel to unfamiliar regions is a difficult task for novice
   travelers. The burden can be eased if the resident of the area offers to
   help. In this paper, we propose a social itinerary recommendation by
   learning from multiple user-generated digital trails, such as GPS
   trajectories of residents and travel experts. In order to recommend
   satisfying itinerary to users, we present an itinerary model in terms of
   attributes extracted from user-generated GPS trajectories. On top of
   this itinerary model, we present a social itinerary recommendation
   framework to find and rank itinerary candidates. We evaluated the
   efficiency of our recommendation method against baseline algorithms with
   a large set of user-generated GPS trajectories collected from Beijing,
   China. First, systematically generated user queries are used to compare
   the recommendation performance in the algorithmic level. Second, a user
   study involving current residents of Beijing is conducted to compare
   user perception and satisfaction on the recommended itinerary. Third, we
   compare mobile-only approach with Mobile+Cloud architecture for
   practical mobile recommender deployment. Lastly, we discuss
   personalization and adaptation factors in social itinerary
   recommendation throughout the paper.

AB Individuals tend to follow their own preferred paths when traveling to
   specific places. Information on these routes could be utilized to build
   various intelligent LBSs. In order to predict a current user's route,
   various approaches have been researched. In this paper, we suggest a
   practical approach to learning users' route patterns from their
   histories and using that information to predict specific routes. In
   cases where existing routes overlap, i.e., where parts of routes are the
   same, in a user's route model, it is difficult to identify the user's
   intended path. For more accurate prediction, firstly, we extract route
   patterns by adopting image processing. Secondly, we build a
   state-observation model reflecting users' intentions, based on route
   patterns, temporal features and weather information. Our approach
   consist of four steps: recognizing regions for splitting routes into
   trip segments, route pattern mining, learning users' route models and
   trip route prediction. Our method achieved a prediction accuracy of
   96.4% in tests performed with 15 smartphone users.

AB Recent research on geographical data mining that focuses on user
   behavior is lacking some fundamental aspects; measurements rely on large
   quantities of geographic data and lack contextual information. This work
   introduces a novel knowledge discovery architecture that brings together
   machine learning techniques with readily available information from
   popular Location Social Networks, in order to enrich geographical
   locations with context and add meaning to user behavior. Results show
   that through analysis of context enriched data we are capable of
   inferring context for detected user points of interest and patterns,
   such as where the user lives, works and spends his free time, without a
   large quantity of information or prior knowledge of the user and his
   private data.
