AB The attractive feature of conveniently deployed as an aerial access
   point (AP) to provide coverage and improve network performance, has made
   the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks a research hotspot. In this
   paper, an UAV handover mechanism in the three-dimensional space is
   proposed. We build and train user trajectory prediction model based on
   neural network. Then we described the handover mechanism under the
   condition of predicted trajectory and the constructed signal
   transmission model in UAV networks. Simulation results show that
   compared to the traditional handover algorithm, our scheme nearly 10%
   higher in handover success rate.

AB The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for aid in unmanned ground
   vehicle (UGV) navigation makes it possible to plan routes more
   efficiently. Aerial images contain information about the environment
   that would be hard to obtain from the surface. This can be exploited to
   provide ground robots with route instructions. Digital image processing
   and computer vision techniques can identify regions of interest for UGV
   traversal. This article brings forth the concept of traversal difficulty
   image (TDI) and proposes techniques for TDI computation, with images
   taken from UAVs as input. We analyze the performance of four techniques
   and our results show that at least three of them can consistently
   identify levels of traversal difficulty associated with regions in the
   input image.

AB With the rising popularity of social media in the past few years,
   several researches ratiocinate that this type of interactive and
   collaborative technology could be a beneficial tool for the sharing of
   tacit knowledge. Nevertheless, very few literatures have tackled the
   subject of how social media could facilitate tacit knowledge sharing
   among medical practitioners, and what are its contributions in the area.
   Thus, the factors that drive individuals to share tacit knowledge need
   to be investigated further and included in literature. Through a
   systematic literature review, this study proposes seven enabling
   conditions which could potentially facilitate the sharing of tacit
   knowledge. TAM was applied as a novelty in this study in investigating
   the factors influencing knowledge sharing via social media, whilst
   taking into account the mediation effects of Attitude in social media
   usage. This study uncovered an important correlation between virtual
   settings and the conversion of tacit knowledge, which affects
   organizational members who are not co-located physically but have a
   crucial need for sharing information.

AB With the increasing sensing ability of smartphone, both recognizing and
   understanding a user's activity using sensor data have become a popular
   topic of ubiquitous computing systems. Individual transportation mode
   identification can provide essential data for road planning and traffic
   management. In this paper, we present a Convolutional Neural Networks
   (CNN) based method to extract expressive and discriminative features
   automatically for transportation mode identification. The signal
   preprocessing in the time and frequency domain is performed before the
   sensor data is fed into the deep learning framework. We optimize various
   important hyper-parameters such as learning rate, kernel size and number
   of convolutional layers to adapt the characteristics of multiple sensor
   signals. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed CNN
   based transportation mode identification algorithm can achieve 98%
   accuracy to distinguish between car, bus, train and metro, which
   outperforms the Support Vector Machines and Adaboost based
   transportation identification with better robustness and generalization.

AB Smartphone users can conveniently install a set of apps that provide
   Location Based Service (LBS) from markets. These LBS-based apps
   facilitate users in many application scenarios, but they raise concerns
   on the breach of privacy related to location access. Smartphone users
   can hardly perceive location access, especially when it happens in
   background. In comparison to location access in foreground, location
   access in background could result in more serious privacy breach because
   it can continuously know a user's locations. In this paper, we study the
   problem of location access in background, and especially perform the
   first measurement of this background action on the Google app market.
   Our investigation demonstrates that many popular apps conduct location
   access in background within short intervals. This enables these apps to
   collect a user's location trace, from which the important personal
   information, Points of Interest (Pots), can be recognized. We further
   extract a user's movement pattern from the Pots, and utilize it to
   measure the extent of privacy breach. The measurement results also show
   that using the combination of movement pattern related metrics and the
   other PoI related metrics can help detect the privacy breach in an
   earlier manner than using either one of them alone.

AB The use of mobile devices and GPS technology allow the implementation of
   systems to analyze the context and typical transport activities of a
   user, through the analysis of the location data and acceleration
   sensors. This research includes the processing of data obtained via GPS.
   This processing is intended to detect the mode of transport of a user in
   segments of predefined paths. For classification, velocity profiles that
   identify modes of transport in each segment are used. The software
   implements a Java programming language and the use of Matlab for
   analysis and data filters. The software system is developed into two
   components; the first comprises the filter and transformation of data.
   These data are plotted from decimal coordinates to cartesian
   coordinates. The second presents the classification for the detection of
   transport modes with cartesian coordinates. It also contains the
   analysis of states of kinematic movements. The tests are performed
   through a dataset taken from the GeoLife project of Microsoft Asia. The
   obtained results show a coherent detection on the means of transport
   that the different users use. These users are compared from predefined
   speed profiles.

AB Analysing and mining trajectories pose new challenges for trajectory
   privacy. We are addressing privacy issue for offline (historical)
   trajectories which are generally published for research. A fundamental
   research question in trajectory privacy domain is of trajectory
   anonymisation. k-anonymity is used as a standard for privacy which
   ensures that every entity in the dataset is indistinguishable from (k -
   1) other entities. The proposed work aims at anonymising trajectories
   based on graph split method. We have used technique of constructing
   trajectory graph to simulate spatial and temporal relations of
   trajectories, based on which trajectory k-anonymity sets are found
   through graph split. For the purpose, we have proposed a novel method
   that uses earth mover's distance as a metric to find trajectory
   k-anonymity sets in contrast to Euclidean distance. It is discovered
   through a series of experiments that the proposed method is
   outperforming in terms of low information loss and computation time.

AB The pervasiveness of location-acquisition and mobile computing
   techniques has generated massive spatial trajectory data, which has
   brought great challenges to the management and analysis of such a big
   data. In this paper, we focus on the sub-trajectory dataset profiling
   problem, and aim to extract the representative sub-trajectories from the
   raw trajectory as a subset, called profile, which can best describe the
   whole dataset. This problem is very challenging subject to finding the
   most representative sub-trajectories set by trading off the size and
   quality of the profile. To tackle this problem, we model the features of
   the trajectory dataset from the aspects of density, speed and the
   direction flow. Meanwhile we present our two-step method to select the
   representative trajectories based on the feature model. First, a novel
   trajectory segmentation algorithm is applied on a raw trajectory to
   identify the representative segments concerning their feature
   representativeness and automatically estimate the number of segments and
   the segment borders. Then, a sub-trajectory profiling method is
   performed to yield the most representative sub-trajectories in the
   dataset, based on a local heuristic evolution strategy. We evaluate our
   method based on extensive experiments by using two real-world trajectory
   datasets generated by over 12,000 taxicabs in Beijing and Shanghai. The
   results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods in
   different applications.

AB The wide adoption of location-enabled devices, together with the
   acceptance of services that leverage (personal) data as payment, allows
   scientists to push through some of the previous barriers imposed by data
   insufficiency, ethics and privacy skepticism. The research problems
   whose study require hard-to-obtain data (e.g. transportation mode
   detection, service contextualisation, etc.) have now become more
   accessible to scientists because of the availability of data collecting
   outlets. One such problem is the detection of a user's transportation
   mode. Different fields have approached the problem of transportation
   mode detection with different aims: Location-Based Services (LBS) is a
   field that focuses on understanding the transportation mode in
   real-time, Transportation Science is a field that focuses on measuring
   the daily travel patterns of individuals or groups of individuals, and
   Human Geography is a field that focuses on enriching a trajectory by
   adding domain-specific semantics. While different fields providing
   solutions to the same problem could be viewed as a positive outcome, it
   is difficult to compare these solutions because the reported performance
   indicators depend on the type of approach and its aim (e.g. the
   real-time availability of LBS requires the performance to be computed on
   each classified location). The contributions of this paper are three
   fold. First, the paper reviews the critical aspects desired by each
   research field when providing solutions to the transportation mode
   detection problem. Second, it proposes three dimensions that separate
   three branches of science based on their main interest. Finally, it
   identifies important gaps in research and future directions, that is,
   proposing: widely accepted error measures meaningful for all
   disciplines, methods robust to new data sets and a benchmark data set
   for performance validation.

AB Viruses are the intracellular pathogens that reproduce only in the
   living cell and manipulate the cellular machinery to produce more
   viruses. Viral replications can affect cellular genes of the host in
   multiple cancerous ways. Approximately, 20% of all human oncogenesis is
   caused by cancer-causing viruses known as oncoviruses. Viral infection
   causes chronic inflammation leading to cell death, uncontrollable
   proliferation, and modulated expression of some of the regulatory
   proteins. Oncogenesis is a multistep phenomenon in which normal host
   cells are transformed into cancerous cells on the basis of host genetic
   variability. Oncogenic viruses encode genes that cause viral replication
   and transformation of the host cells to produce viral proteins and
   protein complexes. The phenomenon from basic viral infection to
   tumorigenesis is lengthy due to the involvement of factors like immunity
   complications, cellular mutations, and exposure to other cancerous
   agents. The viruses that are involved in human cancer development are
   Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein-Barr virus
   (EBV), Human papilloma virus (HPV), Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus
   (KSHV), and Human T lymphotrophic virus 1 (HTLV-1). This review article
   summarizes advanced knowledge related to human oncogenic viruses and the
   molecular mechanisms that lead to tumorigenesis in humans.

AB In this paper, we study the problem of how to detect the current
   transportation mode of the user from the smartphone sensors data,
   because this issue is considered crucial for the deployment of a
   multitude of mobility-aware systems, ranging from trace collectors to
   health monitoring and urban sensing systems. Although some feasibility
   studies have been performed in the literature, most of the proposed
   systems rely on the utilization of the GPS and on computational
   expensive algorithms that do not take into account the limited resources
   of mobile phones. On the opposite, this paper focuses on the design and
   implementation of a feasible and efficient detection system that takes
   into account both the issues of accuracy of classification and of energy
   consumption. To this purpose, we propose the utilization of embedded
   sensor data (accelerometer/gyroscope) with a novel meta-classifier based
   on a cascading technique, and we show that our combined approach can
   provide similar performance than a GPS-based classifier, but introducing
   also the possibility to control the computational load based on
   requested confidence. We describe the implementation of the proposed
   system into an Android framework that can be leveraged by third-part
   mobile applications to access context-aware information in a transparent

AB Transport mode information is essential for understanding people's
   movement behavior and travel demand estimation. Current approaches
   extract travel information once the travel is complete. Such approaches
   are limited in terms of generating just-in-time information for a number
   of mobility based applications, e.g., real time mode specific patronage
   estimation. In order to detect the transport modalities from GPS
   trajectories, various machine learning approaches have already been
   explored. However, the majority of them produce only a single conclusion
   from a given set of evidences, ignoring the uncertainty of any mode
   classification. Also, the existing machine learning approaches fall
   short in explaining their reasoning scheme. In contrast, a fuzzy expert
   system can explain its reasoning scheme in a human readable format along
   with a provision of inferring different outcome possibilities, but lacks
   the adaptivity and learning ability of machine learning. In this paper,
   a novel hybrid knowledge driven framework is developed by integrating a
   fuzzy logic and a neural network to complement each other's limitations.
   Thus the aim of this paper is to automate the tuning process in order to
   generate an intelligent hybrid model that can perform effectively in
   near-real time mode detection using GPS trajectory. Tests demonstrate
   that a hybrid knowledge driven model works better than a purely
   knowledge driven model and at per the machine learning models in the
   context of transport mode detection.

AB Traditional travel survey methods have been widely used for collecting
   information about urban mobility although Global Position System (GPS)
   has become an automatic option for collecting more precise data of the
   households since mid-1990s. Many studies on mobility patterns have
   focused on the GPS advantages leaving aside its issues such as the
   quality of the data collected. However, when it comes to extract the
   frequency of the trips and travelled distance, this technology faces
   some gaps due to the related issues such as signal reception and
   time-to-first-fix location that turns out in missing observations and
   respectively unrecognised or over-segmented trips. In this study, we
   focus on two aspects of GPS data for a car-mode, (i) measurement of the
   gaps in the travelled distance and (ii) estimation of the travelled
   distance and the factors that influence the GPS gaps. To asses that, GPS
   tracks are compared to a ground truth source. Additionally, the trips
   are analysed based on the land use (e.g. urban and rural areas) and
   length (e.g. short, medium and long trips). Results from 170
   participants and more than a year of GPS-tracking show that around 9 %
   of the travelled distance is not captured by GPS and it affects more
   short trips than long ones. Moreover, we validate the importance of the
   time spent on the user activity and the land use as factors that
   influence the gaps in GPS.

AB Genomic instability and epigenetic alterations are distinct hallmarks
   shared by cancer and aging. Sirtuins (SIRTs) are class III histone
   deacetylases that regulate gene expression in response to cellular
   metabolic status. SIRTs can modulate chromatin function through direct
   deacetylation of histones and by promoting altered methylation of
   histones and DNA, leading to repression of transcription. They can also
   interact and deacetylate a broad range of transcription factors and
   coregulators, thereby regulating target gene expression both positively
   and negatively. SIRT inhibition may be beneficial in decreasing the risk
   of some cancers, while SIRT activation can exert positive antiaging
   effects and help prevent age-related disease and cancers. Thus, SIRT
   modulation may positively affect the treatment of cancer and age-related
   disorders. In this study, we review emerging data on the effects of
   SIRTs as important regulators of genomic stability and explain the
   biological roles of SIRTs in cancer and aging.

AB The tracking of frequently visited places, also known as stay points, is
   a critical feature in location-aware mobile applications as a way to
   adapt the information and services provided to smartphones users
   according to their moving patterns. Location based applications usually
   employ the GPS receiver along with Wi-Fi hot-spots and cellular cell
   tower mechanisms for estimating user location. Typically, fine-grained
   GPS location data are collected by the smartphone and transferred to
   dedicated servers for trajectory analysis and stay points detection.
   Such Mobile Cloud Computing approach has been successfully employed for
   extending smartphone's battery lifetime by exchanging computation costs,
   assuming that on-device stay points detection is prohibitive. In this
   article, we propose and validate the feasibility of having an
   alternative event-driven mechanism for stay points detection that is
   executed fully on-device, and that provides higher energy savings by
   avoiding communication costs. Our solution is encapsulated in a sensing
   middleware for Android smartphones, where a stream of GPS location
   updates is collected in the background, supporting duty cycling schemes,
   and incrementally analyzed following an event-driven paradigm for stay
   points detection. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
   middleware, real world experiments were conducted under different stress
   levels, validating its power efficiency when compared against a Mobile
   Cloud Computing oriented solution.

AB Despite advances in cartography, mapping is still a costly process which
   involves a substantial amount of manual work. This article presents a
   method for automatically deriving road attributes by analyzing and
   mining movement trajectories (e.g. GPS tracks). We have investigated the
   automatic extraction of eight road attributes: directionality, speed
   limit, number of lanes, access, average speed, congestion, importance,
   and geometric offset; and we have developed a supervised classification
   method (decision tree) to infer them. The extraction of most of these
   attributes has not been investigated previously. We have implemented our
   method in a software prototype and we automatically update the
   OpenStreetMap (OSM) dataset of the Netherlands, increasing its level of
   completeness. The validation of the classification shows variable levels
   of accuracy, e.g. whether a road is a one-or a two-way road is
   classified with an accuracy of 99%, and the accuracy for the speed limit
   is 69%. When taking into account speed limits that are one step away
   (e.g. 60 km/h instead of the classified 50 km/h) the classification
   increases to 95%, which might be acceptable in some use-cases. We
   mitigate this with a hierarchical code list of attributes.

   stationary statuses in the motorized and non-motorized modes, this study
   develops a new inference engine, including two sets of rules. The first

   smartphone sensors while the second sets are extracted from the human
   knowledge to improve the results of the first rules. The experimental
   results reveal that by utilizing Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors
   in the proposed inference engine, it is possible to save 40% energy in
   comparison with the previous research. Moreover, this engine increases

AB Human mobility is important for understanding the evolution of size and
   structure of urban areas, the spatial distribution of facilities, and
   the provision of transportation services. Until recently, exploring
   human mobility in detail was challenging because data collection methods
   consisted of cumbersome manual travel surveys, space-time diaries, or
   interviews. The development of location-aware sensors has significantly
   altered the possibilities for acquiring detailed data on human
   movements. Although this has spurred many methodological developments in
   identifying human movement patterns, many of these methods operate
   solely from the analytical perspective and ignore the environmental
   context within which the movement takes place. In this paper we attempt
   to widen this view and present an integrated approach to the analysis of
   human mobility using a combination of volunteered GPS trajectories and
   contextual spatial information. We propose a new framework for the
   identification of dynamic (travel modes) and static (significant places)
   behaviour using trajectory segmentation, data mining, and
   spatio-temporal analysis. We are interested in examining if and how
   travel modes depend on the residential location, age, or gender of the
   tracked individuals. Further, we explore theorised 'third places', which
   are spaces beyond main locations (home/work) where individuals spend
   time to socialise. Can these places be identified from GPS traces? We
   evaluate our framework using a collection of trajectories from 205
   volunteers linked to contextual spatial information on the types of
   places visited and the transport routes they use. The result of this
   study is a contextually enriched data set that supports new
   possibilities for modelling human movement behaviour.

AB Global navigation satellite systems such as the Global Positioning
   System (GPS) is one of the most important sensors for movement analysis.
   GPS is widely used to record the trajectories of vehicles, animals and
   human beings. However, all GPS movement data are affected by both
   measurement and interpolation errors. In this article we show that
   measurement error causes a systematic bias in distances recorded with a
   GPS; the distance between two points recorded with a GPS is - on average
   - bigger than the true distance between these points. This systematic
   overestimation of distance' becomes relevant if the influence of
   interpolation error can be neglected, which in practice is the case for
   movement sampled at high frequencies. We provide a mathematical
   explanation of this phenomenon and illustrate that it functionally
   depends on the autocorrelation of GPS measurement error (C). We argue
   that C can be interpreted as a quality measure for movement data
   recorded with a GPS. If there is a strong autocorrelation between any
   two consecutive position estimates, they have very similar error. This
   error cancels out when average speed, distance or direction is
   calculated along the trajectory. Based on our theoretical findings we
   introduce a novel approach to determine C in real-world GPS movement
   data sampled at high frequencies. We apply our approach to pedestrian
   trajectories and car trajectories. We found that the measurement error
   in the data was strongly spatially and temporally autocorrelated and
   give a quality estimate of the data. Most importantly, our findings are
   not limited to GPS alone. The systematic bias and its implications are
   bound to occur in any movement data collected with absolute positioning
   if interpolation error can be neglected.

   availability of trajectory data. As a result, researchers devoted their
   efforts to developing analysis methods including different data mining
   methods for trajectories. However, the research in this direction has so
   far produced mostly isolated studies and we still lack an integrated
   view of problems in applications of trajectory mining that were solved,
   the methods used to solve them, and applications using the obtained
   solutions. In this paper, we first discuss generic methods of trajectory
   mining and the relationships between them. Then, we discuss and classify
   application problems that were solved using trajectory data and relate
   them to the generic mining methods that were used and real world
   applications based on them. We classify trajectory-mining application
   problems under major problem groups based on how they are related. This
   classification of problems can guide researchers in identifying new
   application problems. The relationships between the methods together
   with the association between the application problems and mining methods
   can help researchers in identifying gaps between methods and inspire
   them to develop new methods. This paper can also guide analysts in
   choosing a suitable method for a specific problem. The main contribution
   of this paper is to provide an integrated view relating applications of

AB Indoor positioning systems have the potential to replicate the success

AB In this paper, a solution to the problem of Active Authentication using

   verification on mobile devices using historical location traces of the
   user as a function of time. Considering the movement of a human as a
   Markovian motion, a modified Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based solution is
   proposed. The proposed method, namely the Marginally Smoothed HMM
   (MSHMM), utilizes the marginal probabilities of location and timing
   information of the observations to smooth-out the emission probabilities
   while training. Hence, it can efficiently handle unforeseen observations
   during the test phase. The verification performance of this method is
   compared to a sequence matching (SM) method, a Markov Chain-based method
   (MC) and an HMM with basic Laplace Smoothing (HMM-lap). Experimental
   results using the location information of the UMD Active Authentication
   Dataset-02 (UMDAA02) and the GeoLife dataset are presented. The proposed
   MSHMM method outperforms the compared methods in terms of equal error
   rate (EER). Additionally, the effects of different parameters on the

AB This paper addresses the problem of feature extraction for estimating
   users' transportation modes from their movement trajectories. Previous
   studies have adopted supervised learning approaches and used engineers'
   skills to find effective features for accurate estimation. However, such
   hand-crafted features cannot always work well because human behaviors
   are diverse and trajectories include noise due to measurement error. To
   compensate for the shortcomings of hand-crafted features, we propose a
   method that automatically extracts additional features using a deep
   neural network (DNN). In order that a DNN can easily handle input
   trajectories, our method converts a raw trajectory data structure into

AB This paper puts forward a method that automatically detects trips and
   trip segments with data on the instantaneous movement attributes of
   individuals that can be collected automatically by smartphone sensors.
   The goal is to enhance the accuracy of the data collected through the
   better identification of single-mode trips and trip segments while
   minimizing the participant's involvement and preserving battery life.
   The proposed method works independently of data from external sources
   and can be implemented in smartphone applications to enhance the
   accuracy of the data that are collected and minimize the amount of data
   that need to be transferred. The method consists of a combination of
   real-time processing and postprocessing of the data and incorporates a
   series of rules to clean, split, and merge trips and trip segments, if
   required. The performance of the model was evaluated in a real-world
   experiment, in which it achieved an overall accuracy of 97% for the
   detection of trips from records of daily tracks. The analysis of the
   results shows that the implementation of the trip detection model
   increased the proportion of nonmotorized trips detected by 6%. In
   addition, the implementation of the model increased the accuracy of the
   data on the duration and the length of the recorded trips.

AB Floating car data (FCD) recorded with the Global Positioning System
   (GPS) are an important data source for traffic research. However, FCD
   are subject to error, which can relate either to the accuracy of the
   recordings (measurement error) or to the temporal rate at which the data
   are sampled (interpolation error). Both errors affect movement
   parameters derived from the FCD, such as speed or direction, and
   consequently influence conclusions drawn about the movement. In this
   paper we combined recent findings about the autocorrelation of GPS
   measurement error and well-established findings from random walk theory
   to analyse a set of real-world FCD. First, we showed that the
   measurement error in the FCD was affected by positive autocorrelation.
   We explained why this is a quality measure of the data. Second, we
   evaluated four metrics to assess the influence of interpolation error.
   We found that interpolation error strongly affects the correct
   interpretation of the car's dynamics (speed, direction), whereas its
   impact on the path (travelled distance, spatial location) was moderate.
   Based on these results we gave recommendations for recording of FCD
   using the GPS. Our recommendations only concern time-based sampling,
   change-based, location-based or event-based sampling are not discussed.
   The sampling approach minimizes the effects of error on movement
   parameters while avoiding the collection of redundant information. This
   is crucial for obtaining reliable results from FCD.

AB Rooted in the philosophy of point-and segment-based approaches for
   transportation mode segmentation of trajectories, the measures that
   researchers have adopted to evaluate the quality of the results (1) are
   incomparable across approaches, hence slowing the progress in the field
   and (2) do not provide insight about the quality of the continuous
   transportation mode segmentation. To address these problems, this paper
   proposes new error measures that can be applied to measure how well a
   continuous transportation mode segmentation model performs. The error
   measures introduced are based on aligning multiple inferred continuous
   intervals to ground truth intervals, and measure the cardinality of the
   alignment and the spatial and temporal discrepancy between the
   corresponding aligned segments. The utility of this new way of computing
   errors is shown by evaluating the segmentation of three generic
   transportation mode segmentation approaches (implicit,
   explicit-holistic, and explicit-consensus-based transport mode
   segmentation), which can be implemented in a thick client architecture.
   Empirical evaluations on a large real-word data set reveal the
   superiority of explicit-consensus-based transport mode segmentation,
   which can be attributed to the explicit modeling of segments and
   transitions, which allows for a meaningful decomposition of the complex
   learning task.

AB Road congestion has been one of the major issues in most metropolises,
   and thus, it is crucial to detect road congestions effectively and
   efficiently. Traditional solutions require the deployment of dedicated
   sensors on the roadside or on the vehicles, which suffer from high
   installation and maintenance costs and limited coverage. In this paper,
   we propose an alternative solution by exploiting the sensing ability of
   mobile phones. However, it is challenging to detect road congestions in
   a daily-living environment using undedicated mobile phones while
   guaranteeing energy efficiency. The proposed system only depends on the
   accelerometer and cellular signal, which have been proven to be energy
   efficient as compared with other built-in sensors (e.g., GPS). It
   consists of three interactive modules: (a) an accelerometer-based
   vehicular movement detection module for detecting the periods when the
   mobile phone user is traveling by vehicle; (b) a map-matching module
   relying on the cellular signal for determining the traveled road
   segments; and (c) a road congestion estimation module for inferring the
   congestion degree of the traveled road segments. We evaluated the
   proposed system based on real-world datasets, with promising results.

AB Over the past couple of decades, there has been an exponential increase
   in the collection of large-scale GPS data from household/personal travel
   surveys all over the world. A range of algorithms, which vary from
   specific rules to advanced machine learning methods, have been applied
   to extract travel modes from raw GPS data collected by smartphone-based
   travel surveys. However, most of the methods applied neither describe
   the interaction between features influencing the travel mode decision
   nor effectively deal with the ambiguity inherently incorporated in these
   features. This paper identifies travel modes with a Bayesian network,
   whose structure is established based on a K2 algorithm and corresponding
   conditional probability tables are estimated with maximum likelihood
   methods. Five representative travel modes walk, bike, e-bike, bus and
   car are distinguished using the resulting Bayesian network.
   Additionally, the low speed rate and the average heading change are
   introduced to reduce uncertainties between bike and e-bike segments and
   between bus and car segments. The derived travel modes are then compared
   with those retrieved in the prompted recall survey by telephones.
   Consequently, more than 86% of segments have the travel mode correctly
   identified for each travel mode, with over 97% of walk segments being
   properly flagged. Results from the study demonstrate that GPS travel
   surveys provide an opportunity to supplement traditional travel surveys.

AB In the taxicab industry, a long-standing challenge is how to reduce
   taxicabs' miles spent without fares, i.e., cruising miles. The current
   solutions for this challenge usually depend on passengers to actively
   provide their locations in advance for pickups. To address this
   challenge without the burden on passengers, in this paper, we propose a
   cruising system, pCruise, for taxicab drivers to find efficient routes
   to pick up passengers to reduce cruising miles. According to the
   real-time pick-up events from nearby taxicabs, pCruise characterizes a
   cruising process with a cruising graph, and assigns weights on edges of
   the cruising graph to indicate the utility of cruising corresponding
   road segments. Our weighting process considers the number of nearby
   passengers and taxicabs together in real-time, aiming at two scenarios
   where taxicabs are explicitly or implicitly coordinated with each other.
   Based on a weighted cruising graph, when a taxicab becomes vacant,
   pCruise provides a distributed online scheduling strategy to obtain and
   update an efficient cruising route with the minimum length and at least
   one arriving passenger. We evaluate pCruise based on a real-world GPS
   dataset from a Chinese city Shenzhen with 14,000 taxicabs. The
   evaluation results show that pCruise assists taxicab drivers to reduce
   cruising miles by 42 percent on average.

AB The collection of massive Global Positioning System (GPS) data from
   travel surveys has increased exponentially worldwide since the 1990s. A
   number of methods, which range from rule-based to advanced
   classification approaches, have been applied to detect travel modes from
   GPS positioning data collected in travel surveys based on GPS-enabled
   smartphones or dedicated GPS devices. Among these approaches, neural
   networks (NNs) are widely adopted because they can extract subtle
   information from training data that cannot be directly obtained by human
   or other analysis techniques. However, traditional NNs, which are
   generally trained by back-propagation algorithms, are likely to be
   trapped in local optimum. Therefore, particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   is introduced to train the NNs. The resulting PSO-NNs are employed to
   distinguish among four travel modes (walk, bike, bus, and car) with GPS
   positioning data collected through a smartphone-based travel survey. As
   a result, 95.81% of samples are correctly flagged for the training set,
   while 94.44% are correctly identified for the test set. Results from
   this study indicate that smartphone-based travel surveys provide an
   opportunity to supplement traditional travel surveys.

AB The research of collective behavior has attracted a lot of attention in
   recent years, which can empower various applications, such as
   recommendation systems and intelligent transportation systems. However,
   in traditional social science, it is practically difficult to collect
   large-scale user behavior data. Fortunately, with the ubiquity of
   smartphones and Location Based Social Networks (LBSNs), users
   continuously report their activities online, which massively reflect
   their collective behavior. In this paper, we propose NationTelescope, a
   platform that monitors, compares and visualizes large-scale nation-wide
   user behavior in LBSNs. First, it continuously collects user behavior
   data from LBSNs. Second, it automatically generates behavior data
   summary and integrates an interactive map interface for data
   visualization. Third, in order to compare and visualize the behavioral
   differences across countries, it detects the discriminative activities
   according to the related traffic patterns in different countries. By
   implementing a prototype of NationTelescope platform, we evaluate its
   effectiveness and usability via two case studies and a system usability
   scale survey. The results show that the platform can not only
   efficiently capture, compare and visualize nation-wide collective
   behavior, but also achieve good usability and user experience. (C) 2015

AB Recommender systems are constructed to search the content of interest
   from overloaded information by acquiring useful knowledge from massive
   and complex data. Since the amount of information and the complexity of
   the data structure grow, it has become a more interesting and
   challenging topic to find an efficient way to process, model, and
   analyze the information. Due to the Global Positioning System (GPS) data
   recording the taxi's driving time and location, the GPS-equipped taxi
   can be regarded as the detector of an urban transport system. This paper
   proposes a Taxi-hunting Recommendation System (Taxi-RS) processing the
   large-scale taxi trajectory data, in order to provide passengers with a
   waiting time to get a taxi ride in a particular location. We formulated
   the data offline processing system based on HotSpotScan and Preference
   Trajectory Scan algorithms. We also proposed a new data structure for
   frequent trajectory graph. Finally, we provided an optimized online
   querying subsystem to calculate the probability and the waiting time of
   getting a taxi. Taxi-RS is built based on the real-world trajectory data
   set generated by 12 000 taxis in one month. Under the condition of
   guaranteeing the accuracy, the experimental results show that our system
   can provide more accurate waiting time in a given location compared with
   a naive algorithm.

AB Mobile multimedia services are gaining great momentum among subscribers
   of mobile networks (MNs). An understanding of the network traffic
   behavior is essential in the evolution of today's MNs and, thus, leads
   to more efficient planning and management of the network's scarce
   bandwidth resources. The communication efficiency can be largely
   improved (i.e., optimizing the allocation of the network's limited
   resources and sustaining a desirable quality of service) if the network
   anticipates the needs of its users on the move and, thus, performs
   reservation of radio resources at cells along the path to the
   destination. In this vein, we propose a mobility prediction scheme for
   MNs; more specifically, we first apply probability and Dempster-Shafer
   processes for predicting the likelihood of the next destination, for an
   arbitrary user in an MN, based on the user's habits (e.g., frequently
   visited locations). Then, at each road junction, we apply the
   second-order Markov chain process for predicting the likelihood of the
   next road segment transition, given the path from the trip origin to
   that specific road junction and the direction to the destination. We
   evaluate our proposed scheme using real-life mobility traces; the
   simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms traditional
   schemes.

AB The advances in location-acquisition and mobile computing techniques
   have generated massive spatial trajectory data, which represent the
   mobility of a diversity of moving objects, such as people, vehicles, and
   animals. Many techniques have been proposed for processing, managing,
   and mining trajectory data in the past decade, fostering a broad range
   of applications. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey on the
   major research into trajectory data mining, providing a panorama of the
   field as well as the scope of its research topics. Following a road map
   from the derivation of trajectory data, to trajectory data
   preprocessing, to trajectory data management, and to a variety of mining
   tasks (such as trajectory pattern mining, outlier detection, and
   trajectory classification), the survey explores the connections,
   correlations, and differences among these existing techniques. This
   survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into
   other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more
   data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied. Finally,

AB In real world scenarios, people's movement include several environments
   rather than one, for example, road network, pavement areas and indoor.
   This imposes a new challenge for moving objects database that the
   complete trip needs to be managed by a database system. In the meantime,
   novel queries regarding different transportation modes should also be
   supported. Since existing methods are limited to trips in a single
   environment and do not support queries on moving objects with different
   transportation modes, new technologies are essentially needed in a
   database system. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark called GMOBench
   that aims to evaluate the performance of a database system managing
   moving objects in different environments. GMOBench is settled in a
   realistic scenario and is comprised of three components: (1) a data
   generator with the capability of creating a scalable set of trips
   representing the complete movement of humans (both indoor and outdoor);
   (2) a set of carefully designed and benchmark queries; (3) Mode-RTree,
   an index structure for managing generic moving objects. The generator
   defines some parameters so that users can control the characteristics of
   results. We create the benchmark data in such a way that the dataset can
   mirror important characteristics and real world distributions of human
   mobility. Efficient access methods and optimization techniques are
   developed for query processing. In particular, we propose an index
   structure called Mode-RTree to manage moving objects in different
   environments. By employing the proposed index, the cost of benchmark
   queries is greatly reduced. GMOBench is implemented in a real database
   system to have a practical result. We perform an extensive experimental
   study on comprehensive datasets to evaluate the performance. The results
   show that by using the Mode-RTree we achieve significant performance
   improvement over the baseline method, demonstrating the effectiveness
   and efficiency of our approaches.

AB Existing social networking services recommend friends to users based on
   their social graphs, which may not be the most appropriate to reflect a
   user's preferences on friend selection in real life. In this paper, we
   present Friendbook, a novel semantic-based friend recommendation system
   for social networks, which recommends friends to users based on their
   life styles instead of social graphs. By taking advantage of sensor-rich
   smartphones, Friendbook discovers life styles of users from user-centric
   sensor data, measures the similarity of life styles between users, and
   recommends friends to users if their life styles have high similarity.
   Inspired by text mining, we model a user's daily life as life documents,
   from which his/her life styles are extracted by using the Latent
   Dirichlet Allocation algorithm. We further propose a similarity metric
   to measure the similarity of life styles between users, and calculate
   users' impact in terms of life styles with a friend-matching graph. Upon
   receiving a request, Friendbook returns a list of people with highest
   recommendation scores to the query user. Finally, Friendbook integrates
   a feedback mechanism to further improve the recommendation accuracy. We
   have implemented Friendbook on the Android-based smartphones, and
   evaluated its performance on both small-scale experiments and
   large-scale simulations. The results show that the recommendations
   accurately reflect the preferences of users in choosing friends.

AB The ubiquitous presence of sensor-rich smartphones offers excellent
   opportunities to capture and monitor individuals' contexts and
   activities such as the utilized modes of transport. Most of the current
   systems inferring transportation modes involve continuous sensing of GPS
   or acceleration modules, which inconveniently decreases the battery
   lifetime. This paper presents a more battery-efficient approach for
   transportation mode detection. This approach introduces an additional
   component able to detect whether a user is using any transportation mean
   or none at all, based on cellular network information only. Using this a
   priori knowledge, our inference model is able to avoid the
   battery-exhausting transportation mode detection when users are not
   travelling. Based on experiments involving six participants we show that
   our approach allows the transportation modes car, train and walk to be
   distinguished with an accuracy of 95.7%. Tests on a dataset collected by
   nine participants show that the a priori knowledge can be obtained with
   an accuracy of 85%. Further experiments reveal that our approach is able
   to gain 75% of battery lifetime. Finally, we outline an implementation
   of our detection approach providing flexible means to configure the use
   of smartphone sensors and thus supporting the kind of experiments
   presented in this paper.

AB Heart isolation (separating the heart from the neighboring tissues,
   e.g., lung, liver, and rib cage) is a prerequisite to generate a 3D
   volume visualization as an intuitive view for coronary disease diagnosis
   and treatment planning. Previously, we proposed a component-carving
   based heart isolation approach by removing unwanted background tissues
   (e.g., non-cardiac structures, left atrial appendage, and pulmonary
   veins/arteries) sequentially. However, the final mask usually has many
   small extra pieces due to the difficulty to model and segment all
   background tissues. In this paper, we propose a component-composition
   based approach, which starts from an empty mask and then adds in wanted
   components (coronary arteries, four chambers, and the aorta) segmented
   from the original image. The proposed method can generate a much cleaner
   mask than the component-carving approach since only the wanted
   structures are added and the segmentation of the heart chambers and the
   aorta is more robust and accurate due to their greater predictability.
