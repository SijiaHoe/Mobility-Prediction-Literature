AB The discovery of movement patterns from trajectory data is crucial for
   supporting many location-based applications. Most existing methods
   require that the trajectories contain explicit location information.
   However, it is usually difficult to collect such kind of trajectories
   from mobile phone users. In this paper, we propose a method for mining
   movement patterns from cell-id trajectories (i.e., sequences of cell
   tower identifiers) without explicit location information. Specifically,
   we firstly estimate the spatial closeness between cell towers in a
   cell-id trajectory dataset by exploiting the handoff features. Then, we
   propose a novel sequential pattern mining algorithm to mine movement
   patterns from the cell-id trajectory dataset by taking into account the
   estimated spatial closeness. We evaluated the proposed method based on a
   real cell-id trajectory dataset. The experiment results show that the
   proposed method can adapt to the high uncertainty of cell-id
   trajectories and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
   efficiency, completeness, and usefulness. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Point-of-interest (POI) recommendations are a popular form of
   personalized service in which users share their POI location and related
   content with their contacts in location-based social networks (LBSNs).
   The similarity and relatedness between users of the same POI type are
   frequently used for trajectory retrieval, but most of the existing works
   rely on the explicit characteristics from all users' check-in records
   without considering individual activities. We propose a POI
   recommendation method that attempts to optimally recommend POI types to
   serve multiple users. The proposed method aims to predict destination
   POIs of a user and search for similar users of the same regions of
   interest, thus optimizing the user acceptance rate for each
   recommendation. The proposed method also employs the variable-order
   Markov model to determine the distribution of a user's POIs based on his
   or her travel histories in LBSNs. To further enhance the user's
   experience, we also apply linear discriminant analysis to cluster the
   topics related to Travel and connect to users with social links or
   similar interests. The probability of POIs based on users' historical
   trip data and interests in the same topics can be calculated. The system
   then provides a list of the recommended destination POIs ranked by their
   probabilities. We demonstrate that our work outperforms
   collaborative-filtering-based and other methods using two real-world
   datasets from New York City. Experimental results show that the proposed
   method is better than other models in terms of both accuracy and recall.
   The proposed POI recommendation algorithms can be deployed in certain
   online transportation systems and can serve over 100,000 users.

AB Bike-sharing is a new low-carbon and environment-friendly mode of public
   transport based on the sharing economy. Since 2017, the bike-sharing
   market has boomed in China's major cities. Bikes equipped with GPS
   transmitters are docked along sidewalks that can be easily accessed
   through smartphone apps. However, this new form of transport has also
   led to problems, such as illegal parking, vandalism, and theft, each of
   which presents a major administrative challenge. Further, imbalances in
   user demand and bike availability need to be overcome to ensure a
   convenient, flexible service for customers. Hence, predicting a
   cyclist's destination could be of great importance to shared-bike
   operators. In this paper, we propose an innovative deep learning model
   to predict the most probable destination for each user. The model,
   called destination prediction network based on spatiotemporal data
   (DPNst), comprises three steps. First, the data is preprocessed and a
   pool of likely candidate destinations is generated based on frequent
   item mining. This candidate set is then used to build the DPNst model: a
   long short-term memory network learns the user's behavior; a
   convolutional neural network learns the spatial relationships between
   the origin and the candidate destinations; and a fully connected neural
   network learns the external features. In the final step, DPNst
   dynamically aggregates the output of the three neural networks based on
   the given data and generates the predictions. In a series of experiments
   on real-world stationless bike-sharing data, DPNst returned an F1 score
   of 42.71% and demonstrated better performance overall than the compared
   baselines.

AB Predicting traffic conditions for road segments is the prelude of
   working on intelligent transportation. Many existing methods can be used
   for short-term or long-term traffic prediction, but they focus more on
   regions than on road segments. The lack of fine-grained traffic
   predicting approach hinders the development of ITS. Therefore, MapLSTM,
   a spatio-temporal long short-term memory network preluded by
   map-matching, is proposed in this paper to predict fine-grained traffic
   conditions. MapLSTM first obtains the historical and real-time traffic
   conditions of road segments via map-matching. Then LSTM is used to
   predict the conditions of the corresponding road segments in the future.
   Breaking the single-index forecasting, MapLSTM can predict the vehicle
   speed, traffic volume, and the travel time in different directions of
   road segments simultaneously. Experiments confirmed MapLSTM can not only
   achieve prediction for road segments based a large scale of GPS
   trajectories effectively but also have higher predicting accuracy than
   GPR and ConvLSTM. Moreover, we demonstrate that MapLSTM can serve
   various applications in a lightweight way, such as cognizing driving
   preferences, learning navigation, and inferring traffic emissions.

AB Map matching is a procedure that estimates the route traveled by
   vehicles or people by using observed coordinates. It is an important
   preprocessing procedure for location services based on global
   positioning system (GPS) data obtained from probe vehicles. One recently
   proposed major map matching approach is the hidden Markov model
   (HMM)-based method. However, HMM-based approaches suffer from latency,
   because they rely on the availability of future GPS points. This latency
   limits the ability of real-time traffic sensing and location services.
   This paper presents a novel online map matching algorithm that uses a
   probabilistic route prediction model instead of future GPS points. The
   probabilistic route prediction model can be trained by using historical
   trajectory data. Our experimental results show that the accuracy of the
   untrained proposed model is competitive with a naive online HMM-based
   method without any latency. Moreover, the results show that the trained
   model obtains even higher accuracy. The experimental results also show
   that the proposed method is faster than the online HMM.

AB With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs),
   spatial item recommendation has become an important way of helping users
   discover interesting locations to increase their engagement with
   location-based services. The availability of spatial, temporal, and
   social information in LBSNs offers an unprecedented opportunity to
   enhance the spatial item recommendation. Many previous works studied
   spatial and social influences on spatial item recommendation in LBSNs.
   Due to the strong correlations between a user's check-in time and the
   corresponding check-in location, which include the sequential influence
   and temporal cyclic effect, it is essential for spatial item recommender
   system to exploit the temporal effect to improve the recommendation
   accuracy. Leveraging temporal information in spatial item recommendation
   is, however, very challenging, considering (1) when integrating
   sequential influences, users' check-in data in LBSNs has a low sampling
   rate in both space and time, which renders existing location prediction
   techniques on GPS trajectories ineffective, and the prediction space is
   extremely large, with millions of distinct locations as the next
   prediction target, which impedes the application of classical Markov
   chain models; (2) there are various temporal cyclic patterns (i.e.,
   daily, weekly, and monthly) in LBSNs, but existing work is limited to
   one specific pattern; and (3) there is no existing framework that
   unifies users' personal interests, temporal cyclic patterns, and the
   sequential influence of recently visited locations in a principled
   manner.
   In light of the above challenges, we propose a Temporal Personalized
   Model (TPM), which introduces a novel latent variable topic-region to
   model and fuse sequential influence, cyclic patterns with personal
   interests in the latent and exponential space. The advantages of
   modeling the temporal effect at the topic-region level include a
   significantly reduced prediction space, an effective alleviation of data
   sparsity, and a direct expression of the semantic meaning of users'
   spatial activities. Moreover, we introduce two methods to model the
   effect of various cyclic patterns. The first method is a time indexing
   scheme that encodes the effect of various cyclic patterns into a binary
   code. However, the indexing scheme faces the data sparsity problem in
   each time slice. To deal with this data sparsity problem, the second
   method slices the time according to each cyclic pattern separately and
   explores these patterns in a joint additive model.
   Furthermore, we design an asymmetric Locality Sensitive Hashing (ALSH)
   technique to speed up the online top-k recommendation process by
   extending the traditional LSH. We evaluate the performance of TPM on two
   real datasets and one large-scale synthetic dataset. The performance of
   TPM in recommending cold-start items is also evaluated. The results
   demonstrate a significant improvement in TPM's ability to recommend
   spatial items, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency, compared
   with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Personalized trip recommendation has drawn much attention recently with
   the development of location-based services. How to utilize the data in
   the location-based social network to recommend a single Point of

   a challenging study because of the diversity of trips and complexity of
   involved computation. This work proposes a

   that considers both relevance and diversity of trips in trip planning.
   An antcolony-optimization-based trip planning algorithm is developed to
   efficiently plan a trip. Finally, case studies and experiments

AB Through the availability of location-acquisition devices, huge volumes
   of spatio-temporal data recording the movement of people is provided.
   Discovery of the group of people who travel together can provide
   valuable knowledge to a variety of critical applications. Existing
   studies on this topic mainly focus on the movement of vehicles or
   animals with forcing the group members to stay always connected.
   However, the movement of people is different; people might belong to the
   same main group while they contribute in various sub-groups during their
   movement. In this paper, we propose a group pattern called loose
   travelling companion pattern (LTCP), which allows the members of a group
   to contribute to various sub-groups as long as the community of members
   does not change during the movement and all of the members stay
   connected for a few time-slots. In addition, we propose weakly
   continuous loose travelling companion pattern (WCLTCP) to relax the
   continuous time constraint in LTCP. Finally, three algorithms have been
   developed to discover the proposed group patterns: (i) straightforward
   approach, (ii) smart-and-fast method, and (iii) and opportunistic
   algorithm. Through the extensive experimental evaluation on both real
   and experimental datasets, the efficiency and effectiveness of the
   proposed group discovery approaches are proven.

AB Activity pattern classification is extensively studied using
   multi-person single-day mobile traces. However, human mobility exhibits
   intra-personal variability and thus single-day activity may not fully
   capture one's activity patterns. This paper creates a methodological
   framework to analyze similarity of activity patterns using frequent
   sequential pattern mining when multi-person multi day data is available.
   Frequent sequential pattern mining discovers the frequently occurring
   ordered subsequences and is a natural approach of analyzing multi-day
   travel patterns. Prefix Span algorithm is implemented to extract
   frequent patterns for each individual. Then similarity measures are
   defined to describe the extent to which two travelers' activity patterns
   are alike and the regularity of how one repeats her activity patterns
   from day to day. Based upon the pairwise similarity values between two
   individuals, hierarchical clustering is conducted to divide travelers
   into communities. To illustrate these methodologies, 349 travelers'
   19,130 travel activity sequences are extracted from the world's first
   connected vehicle testbed in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Three major clusters
   are identified. Coupled with demographics, these clusters are
   characterized as "seniors", "working class", and "parents",
   respectively. Multinomial logistic regression is employed to model to
   what extent the similarity of socio-demographics can explain that of
   travel patterns. This work can be extended to either infer an unknown
   user's demographics (or customer profiling) based on her activity
   patterns, or to reconstruct an unknown user's frequent activity patterns
   based on her demographics and other similar travelers' patterns.

AB Mobile crowdsensing serves as a critical building block for emerging
   Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the sensing devices
   continuously generate a large amount of data, which consumes much
   resources (e.g., bandwidth, energy, and storage) and may sacrifice the
   Quality-of-Service (QoS) of applications. Prior work has demonstrated
   that there is significant redundancy in the content of the sensed data.
   By judiciously reducing redundant data, data size and load can be
   significantly reduced, thereby reducing resource cost and facilitating
   the timely delivery of unique, probably critical information and
   enhancing QoS. This article presents a survey of existing works on
   mobile crowdsensing strategies with an emphasis on reducing resource
   cost and achieving high QoS. We start by introducing the motivation for
   this survey and present the necessary background of crowdsensing and
   IoT. We then present various mobile crowdsensing strategies and discuss
   their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss future research
   directions for mobile crowdsensing for IoT. The survey addresses a broad
   range of techniques, methods, models, systems, and applications related
   to mobile crowdsensing and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyze and
   compare the strategies proposed in prior works, but also to discuss
   their applicability toward the IoT and provide guidance on future
   research directions for mobile crowdsensing.

AB Understanding business behavior in a city requires acquiring huge amount
   of data coming from diverse field studies. The growing use of mobile
   devices in social media provides massive data transactions that can
   replace such data acquired by field studies. Location-based social
   networks' (LBSNs') data can be exploited in urban analysis for economic
   reasons. In this research, the spatial correlation of business turnouts
   for venues registered in LBSNs is studied for business behavior
   predictions. A novel similarity embedded (SE)-spatial interpolation
   technique is proposed for business turnouts' predictions. The proposed
   technique utilizes diverse features provided by LBSNs in the prediction
   process to improve prediction performance. Moreover, a local filter is
   introduced to avoid local extreme involvements in the prediction process
   issuing better prediction results. To test the proposed techniques,
   experimental case study is implemented for predicting business behavior
   of venues registered in Foursquare in Texas. The proposed SE-spatial
   interpolation has shown better prediction accuracy than classical
   spatial interpolation predictions. The additional integration of the
   local filter shows further alleviated prediction errors. Furthermore,
   this study extends the work for the efficient application of the
   proposed prediction technique in big datasets. An iterative nearest
   neighbors first search method is designed for accelerating the execution
   time of the prediction technique implementation regardless the dataset
   size. The proposed method was tested over several size datasets. The
   test results show accelerated execution time for the proposed method
   when compared with the classical implementation execution time. This

AB With the development of information technology, the issue of information
   overload has become an ever-increasing problem throughout this decade.
   In order to provide useful and interesting information to users,
   recommender systems were proposed to actively select preferable items
   for users who potentially desired. In this paper, we focus on
   personalizing aspects of recommender systems, since it is observed that
   the weights of the dimensions should be distinct for every user when
   measuring the similarities between items. To achieve this outcome, we
   suggest that the dimensions of items should be classified into different
   types such as numeric and textual, and then the average preferences (AP)
   should be calculated for these dimensions based on all the users in the
   recommender system. Then, the preference sensitivities (PS) for every
   dimension can be calculated for every user so that finally the dynamic
   feature weights can be applied in the calculations. All these
   aforementioned methodologies are evaluated via experiments using a
   Recipe Recommender System which achieves an 81.0% overall satisfaction
   rate on a basis of more than 50 real volunteer users from diverse

AB Urban travel time information is of great importance for many levels of
   traffic management and operation. This paper develops a tensor-based
   Bayesian probabilistic model for citywide and personalized travel time
   estimation, using the large-scale and sparse GPS trajectories generated
   by taxicabs. Combined with the knowledge learned from historical
   trajectories, travel times of different drivers on all road segments in
   some time slots are modeled with a 3-order tensor. This tensor-based
   modeling approach incorporates both the spatial correlation between
   different road segments and the person-specific variation between
   different drivers, as well as the coarse-grain temporal correlation
   between recent and historical traffic conditions and the fine-grain
   temporal correlation between different time slots. To account for the
   variability caused by the intrinsic uncertainties in urban road network,
   each travel time entry in the built tensor is treated as a variable
   following a log-normal distribution. With the help of the fully Bayesian
   treatment, the model achieves automatic hyper-parameter tuning and model
   complexity controlling, and therefore the problem of over-fitting is
   prevented even when the used data is large-scale and sparse. The
   proposed model is applied to a real case study on the citywide road
   network of Beijing, China, using the large-scale and sparse GPS
   trajectories collected from over 32,670 taxicabs for a period of two
   months. Empirical results of extensive experiments demonstrate that the
   proposed model provides an effective and robust approach for urban
   travel time estimation and outperforms the considered competing methods.

AB For a satisfactory trip planning, the following features are desired: 1)
   automated suggestion of scenes or attractions; 2) personalized based on
   the interest and habits of travelers; 3) maximal coverage of sites of
   interest; and 4) minimal effort such as transporting time on the route.
   Automated scene suggestion requires collecting massive knowledge about
   scene sites and their characteristics, and personalized planning
   requires matching of a traveler profile with knowledge of scenes of
   interest. As a trip contains a sequence of stops at multiple scenes, the
   problem of trip planning becomes optimizing a temporal sequence where
   each stop is weighted. This article presents OrientSTS, a novel
   spatio-temporal sequence (STS) searching system for optimal personalized
   trip planning. OrientSTS provides a knowledge base of scenes with their
   tagged features and season characteristics. By combining personal
   profiles and scene features, OrientSTS generates a set of weighted
   scenes for each city for each user. OrientSTS can then retrieve the
   optimal sequence of scenes in terms of distance, weight, visiting time,
   and scene features. The authors develop alternative algorithms for
   searching optimal sequences, with consideration of the weight of each
   scene, the preference of users, and the travel time constraint. The
   experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms based
   on real datasets from social networks.

AB Recently, with the fast proliferation of smart phones, mobile phone has
   the powerful ability of not only communication but also computation.
   Human beings are not only data consumers, but data producer with their
   objective or subjective sensing needs. Mobile crowd sensing is an
   emerging computing paradigm that tasks everyday mobile devices to form
   participatory sensor networks. It allows the increasing number of mobile
   phone users to share local knowledge acquired by their sensor-enhanced
   devices. Social sensors, social sensor receiver platform, and mobile
   crowd sensing paradigm compose a process by which physical sensors
   present in mobile devices such as GPS are used to infer social
   relationships and human activities. In this survey, we review the mobile
   crowd sensing applications on social sensors based on social sensor
   receiver platform (e.g., Weibo and Twitter) from three categories:
   public security, smart city, and location based services. Most
   applications adopted in current works fit in one of these categories.
   Existing works on applications of mobile crowd sensing on social sensors
   are collected and studied. Some possible future directions of potential
   new application category are proposed and analyzed. (c) 2017 Elsevier

AB Arriving on time and total travel time are two important properties for
   vehicle routing. Existing route guidance approaches always consider them
   independently, because they may conflict with each other. In this
   article, we develop a semi-decentralized multiagent-based vehicle
   routing approach where vehicle agents follow the local route guidance by
   infrastructure agents at each intersection, and infrastructure agents
   perform the route guidance by solving a route assignment problem. It
   integrates the two properties by expressing them as two objective terms
   of the route assignment problem. Regarding arriving on time, it is
   formulated based on the probability tail model, which aims to maximize
   the probability of reaching destination before deadline. Regarding total
   travel time, it is formulated as a weighted quadratic term, which aims
   to minimize the expected travel time from the current location to the
   destination based on the potential route assignment. The weight for
   total travel time is designed to be comparatively large if the deadline
   is loose. Additionally, we improve the proposed approach in two aspects,
   including travel time prediction and computational efficiency.
   Experimental results on real road networks justify its ability to
   increase the average probability of arriving on time, reduce total
   travel time, and enhance the overall routing performance.

AB Real-time human mobility modeling is essential to various urban
   applications. To model such human mobility, numerous data-driven
   techniques have been proposed. However, existing techniques are mostly
   driven by data from a single view, for example, a transportation view or
   a cellphone view, which leads to over-fitting of these single-view
   models. To address this issue, we propose a human mobility modeling
   technique based on a generic multi-view learning framework called
   coMobile. In coMobile, we first improve the performance of single-view
   models based on tensor decomposition with correlated contexts, and then
   we integrate these improved single-view models together for multi-view
   learning to iteratively obtain mutually reinforced knowledge for
   real-time human mobility at urban scale. We implement coMobile based on
   an extremely large dataset in the Chinese city Shenzhen, including data
   about taxi, bus, and subway passengers along with cellphone users,
   capturing more than 27 thousand vehicles and 10 million urban residents.
   The evaluation results show that our approach outperforms a single-view
   model by 51% on average. More importantly, we design a novel application
   where urban taxis are dispatched based on unaccounted mobility demand
   inferred by coMobile.

AB Latent factor (LF)-based models are highly efficient in addressing
   high-dimensional and sparse (HiDS) matrices raised in big-data-related
   applications like recommender systems. While linear biases have proven
   to be effective in improving the prediction accuracy and computational
   efficiency of LF models, their individual and combinational effects in
   such performance gain remain unclear. To address this issue, this work
   aims at studying the effects of linear biases in LF models for
   recommender systems. Based on careful investigations into existing
   methods, we categorize frequently adopted biases into two classes, i.e.,
   preprocessing bias (PB) and training bias (TB). Subsequently, we deduce
   the training objectives and parameter updating rules of LF models with
   different PB and TB combinations. Experimental results on three HiDS
   matrices generated by real recommender systems show that (a) each PB/TB
   does have positive/negative effects in the performance of an LF model;
   (b) Such effects are partially data dependent, however, some specific
   PB/TB can bring stable performance gain to an LF model; and (c) several
   PB and TB combinations appear significantly more effective in improving
   an LF model's performance when compared to their peers. (C) 2017

AB Recently, as location-based social networks (LBSNs) rapidly grow,
   general users utilize point-of-interest recommender systems to discover
   attractive locations. Most existing POI recommendation algorithms always
   employ the check-in data and rich contextual information (e. g.,
   geographical information and users' social network information) of users
   to learn their preference on POIs. Unfortunately, these studies
   generally suffer from two major limitations: (1) when modeling
   geographical influence, users' personalized behavior differences are
   ignored; (2) when modeling the users' social influence, the implicit
   social influence is seldom exploited. In this paper, we propose a novel
   POI recommendation approach called GeoEISo. GeoEISo achieves three key
   goals in this work. (1) We develop a kernel estimation method with a
   selfadaptive kernel bandwidth to model the geographical influence
   between POIs. (2) We use the Gaussian radial basis kernel function based
   support vector regression (SVR) model to predict explicit trust values
   between users, and then devise a novel trust-based recommendation model
   to simultaneously incorporate both the explicit and implicit social
   trust information into the process of POI recommendation. (3) We develop
   a unified geo-social framework which combines users' preference on a POI
   with the geographical influence as well as social correlations.
   Experimental results on two real-world datasets collected from
   Foursquare show that GeoEISo provides significantly superior
   performances compared to other state-of-the-art POI recommendation
   models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommenders work by estimating a
   user's potential preferences on unobserved items referring to the other
   users' observed preferences. Slope-one, as a well-known CF recommender,
   is widely adopted in industrial applications owing to it's (a)
   competitive prediction accuracy for user's potential preferences, (b)
   high computational efficiency, and (c) ease of implementation. However,
   current Slope-one-based algorithms are all designed for static datasets,
   which are contradictory to real situations where dynamic datasets are
   mostly involved. This paper focuses on designing incremental Slope-one
   recommenders able to address dynamic datasets, reflecting their
   variations instantly without retraining the whole model. To do so, we
   have carefully analyzed the parameter training processing of
   Slope-one-based recommenders to design the incremental update rules for
   involved parameters reflecting data increments in dynamic environments.
   Three incremental Slope-one recommenders, including the incremental
   Slope-one, incremental weighted Slope-one, and incremental bi-polar
   slope one, are proposed. Experimental results on two large real datasets
   indicate that the proposed incremental slope-one recommenders can
   correctly reflect the increments of dynamic datasets with high
   computational efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Travel recommendation systems provide suggestions to the users based on
   different information, such as user preferences, needs, or constraints.
   The recommendation may also take into account some characteristics of
   the points of interest (POIs) to be visited, such as the opening hours,
   or the peak hours. Although a number of studies have been proposed on
   the topic, most of them tailor the recommendation considering the user
   viewpoint, without evaluating the impact of the suggestions on the
   system as a whole. This may lead to oscillatory dynamics, where the
   choices made by the system generate new peak hours.
   This paper considers the trip planning problem that takes into account
   the balancing of users among the different POIs. To this aim, we
   consider the estimate of the level of crowding at POIs, including both
   the historical data and the effects of the recommendation. We formulate
   the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, and we design a
   recommendation engine that explores the solution space in near
   real-time, through a distributed version of the Simulated Annealing
   approach. Through an experimental evaluation on a real dataset, we show
   that our solution is able to provide high quality recommendations, yet
   maintaining that the attractions are not overcrowded.

AB Travelling is a critical component of daily life. With new technology,
   personalized travel route recommendations are possible and have become a
   new research area. A personalized travel route recommendation refers to
   plan an optimal travel route between two geographical locations, based
   on the road networks and users' travel preferences. In this paper, we
   define users' travel behaviours from their historical Global Positioning
   System (GPS) trajectories and propose two personalized travel route
   recommendation methods - collaborative travel route recommendation
   (CTRR) and an extended version of CTRR (CTRR+). Both methods consider
   users' personal travel preferences based on their historical GPS
   trajectories. In this paper, we first estimate users' travel behaviour
   frequencies by using collaborative filtering technique. A route with the
   maximum probability of a user's travel behaviour is then generated based
   on the naive Bayes model. The CTRR+ method improves the performances of
   CTRR by taking into account cold start users and integrating distance
   with the user travel behaviour probability. This paper also conducts
   some case studies based on a real GPS trajectory data set from Beijing,
   China. The experimental results show that the proposed CTRR and CTRR+
   methods achieve better results for travel route recommendations compared
   with the shortest distance path method.

AB The rapid expansion of urbanization and the fast pace of life result in
   abundant choices with little time for people to manage routes. A proper
   planning route enables us to enjoy life better with fewer time and
   energy costs. Therefore, route planning becomes too valuable to be
   ignored. At the same time, with the popularity of mobile devices,
   location sensing, and Web 2.0 technologies, location-based social
   networks (e. g., Facebook Palaces and Foursquare) have attracted
   millions of users to share their visited locations and other
   information, which generates large amounts of user check-in data. These
   data can be used to mine users' preferences and time information for
   recommending routes. In this paper, we propose FineRoute, a personalized
   and time-sensitive route recommendation system. We take three factors
   that user' preferences, proper visiting time, and transition time into
   consideration for the route generation. First, we infer users'
   preferences by constructing a three-dimensional tensor, with three
   dimensions representing users, locations, and time, respectively.
   Second, we obtain the proper visiting time for certain locations, as
   well as the transition time between two locations from the check-in
   dataset. Moreover, we adopt Kullback-Leibler divergence in order to
   measure the quality of a route in terms of the proper visiting month and
   the proper visiting hour. Finally, we propose a route generation
   algorithm by extending the classic longest path algorithm. We conduct
   experiments on a real-world check-in dataset and the results demonstrate
   the effectiveness of our scheme.

AB It is well known that recommender systems rely on the similarity between
   items to be recommended. Most current research projects in this area
   utilize traditional similarity measurement algorithms, such as cosine
   distance or derivatives of these. However, the most challenging problem
   facing these approaches is to quantify the non-numerical attributes of
   items. This is quite intractable and cannot be solved with regular
   similarity measurement algorithms. This paper proposes two novel
   methods, the Taxonomic Trees Similarity Measurement (TTSM) and the
   Decomposed Structures Similarity Measurement (SDSM), so that the
   similarities between the textual attributes can be measured using
   numeric values after they have been quantified. Also, the quantifying
   process is completely based on the semantic meanings of the textual
   terms. Furthermore, a maximized term matching (MTM) mechanism is induced
   and applied to the group-based textual attributes of items in
   recommender systems. Finally, we evaluate our methods by implementing a
   recipe recommender system which achieves a 74.4% overall satisfaction
   rate as evaluated by real users. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Geographic services based on GPS trajectory data, such as location
   prediction and recommender services, have received increasing attention
   because of their potential social and commercial benefits. In this
   study, a Geographic Service Recommender Model (GSRM) is proposed, which
   loosely comprises three essential steps. Firstly, location sequences are
   obtained through a clustering operation on GPS locations. To improve
   efficiency, a programming model with a distributed algorithm is employed
   to accelerate the clustering. Secondly, in order to mine spatial and
   temporal information from the cluster trajectory, an algorithm
   (MiningMP) is designed. Last but not least, the next possible location
   to which the user will travel is predicted. An integrated framework of
   GSRM could then be constructed and provide the appropriate geographic
   recommendation service by considering location sequences as well as
   other related semantic information. Experiments were conducted based on
   real GPS trajectories from Microsoft Research Asia (182 users within a
   period of five years). The experimental results clearly demonstrate that
   our proposed GSRM model is effective and efficient at predicting
   locations and can provide users with personalized smart recommendation
   services in the following possible position with excellent performance
   in scalability, adaptability, and quality of service.

   present applications performed on a dataset (communication events +
   handovers and location automatic updates) collected by Orange operator
   from March 31 to April 11, 2009 for the whole Paris Region. Data allow
   producing pseudo real-time spatiotemporal trajectory of devices. But the
   trajectory is not sufficient to determine trips. We need to introduce
   assumptions to generate origin and destination.
   In order to test the accuracy of mobile phone trip matrix, we confront
   it with the matrix built from household travel survey data at
   conurbation level in Paris Region (Enquete Globale Transport). Results
   appear promising for the comparison with household travel survey data
   for which we obtain rather good matching for each cell of

AB As mobile device penetration increases, it has become pervasive for
   images to be associated with locations in the form of geotags. Geotags
   bridge the gap between the physical world and the cyberspace, giving
   rise to new opportunities to extract further insights into user
   preferences and behaviors. In this article, we aim to exploit geotagged
   photos from online photo-sharing sites for the purpose of personalized
   Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation. Owing to the fact that most
   users have only very limited travel experiences, data sparseness poses a
   formidable challenge to personalized POI recommendation. To alleviate
   data sparseness, we propose to augment current collaborative filtering
   algorithms along from multiple perspectives. Specifically, hybrid
   preference cues comprising user-uploaded and user-favored photos are
   harvested to study users' tastes. Moreover, heterogeneous high-order
   relationship information is jointly captured from user social networks
   and POI multimodal contents with hypergraph models. We also build upon
   the matrix factorization algorithm to integrate the disparate sources of
   preference and relationship information, and apply our approach to
   directly optimize user preference rankings. Extensive experiments on a
   large and publicly accessible dataset well verified the potential of our
   approach for addressing data sparseness and offering quality
   recommendations to users, especially for those who have only limited

   difficult to learn travel preferences, because a user usually visits
   only a limited number of travel locations. Static topic models can be
   used to solve the sparsity problem by considering user travel topics.
   However, all travel histories of a user are regarded as one document
   drawn from a set of static topics, ignoring the evolving of topics and
   travel preferences. In this paper, we propose a dynamic topic model
   (DTM) and matrix factorization (MF)-based travel recommendation method.
   A DTM is used to obtain the temporally fine-grained topic distributions
   (i.e., implicit topic information) of users and locations. In addition,
   a large amount of explicit information is extracted from the metadata
   and visual contents of CCGPs, check-ins, and point of interest
   categories datasets. The information is used to obtain user-user and
   location-location similarity information, which is imposed as two
   regularization terms to constraint MF. The proposed method is evaluated
   on a publicly available Flickr dataset. Experimental results demonstrate
   that the proposed method can generate significantly superior
   recommendations compared to other state-of-the-art travel location
   recommendation studies.

AB Travel products recommendation has become one of emerging issues in the
   realm of recommendation systems. The widely-used collaborative filtering
   algorithms are usually difficult to be used for recommending travel
   products due to a number of reasons, including (1) the content of travel
   products is very complex, (2) the user-item matrix is extremely sparse,
   and (3) the cold-start users are widely existing. To tackle these
   issues, we try to exploit Web server logs for generating recommendation,
   and present a novel recommendation engine (SECT for short) for travel
   products based on topic sequential patterns. In detail, we first extract
   topics from semantic description of every Web page. Then, we mine topic
   frequent sequential patterns and their target products to form click
   patterns library. At last, we propose a Markov n-gram model for matching
   the real-time click-stream of users with the click patterns library and
   thus computing recommendation scores. Experimental results on a
   real-world travel dataset demonstrate that the SECT prevails over the
   state-of-art baseline algorithms. In particular, SECT shows merits in
   improving the both coverage and accuracy for recommending products to
   cold-start users. Also, SECT is effective to recommend long tail items
   and outperform baseline algorithms.

AB Location-based services (LBS) are now the platforms for aggregating
   relevant information about users and understanding their mobile behavior
   and preferences based on the location histories. The increasing
   availability of large amounts of spatio-temporal data brings us
   opportunities and challenges to automatically discover valuable
   knowledge. While context-aware properties quickly became the key of the
   success of these pervasive applications, information related to user
   preferences and social signals still lack of adequate capitalization.
   Local search in LBSs is a peculiar service where recent and current
   interests, the network of explicit and implicit social interactions
   between users can be combined for effectively performing fine-tuned and
   personalized recommendations of points of interest. In this article we
   present the various and peculiar aspects of local search in mobile

AB People leave traces of movements that might affect the behavior of
   others both online in cyberspace and offline in real space. Previous
   studies, however, have used only questionnaires, network data, or GPS
   data to study spatio-temporal behaviors, ignoring the relationship
   between online and offline activities, and overlooking the influence of
   previous activities on future behaviors. We propose a Pheromone-based
   Fusion Model, viewing human behaviors as similar to insect foraging
   behaviors to model spatio-temporal recreational activity patterns, on
   and offline. In our model, website data were combined with GPS data to
   evaluate the attractiveness of destinations over time using twenty-nine
   landscapes in Beijing, China; big website data and GPS trajectories were
   gathered from 181 users for 57 months. The datasets were portioned into
   two periods. Online and offline recreational pheromones were calculated
   from the first period, and the visitation rates were extracted from the
   second period. These data were subsequently applied in a regression
   analysis to determine unknown parameters and estimate the attractiveness
   of destinations. The proposed method was compared with two other
   approaches that use either GPS data or online data alone, in order to
   verify effectiveness. The results show that the proposed method can
   estimate future behaviors, based on real world and online past actions.

AB This paper develops a principled approach to accurately identify
   interesting places in a city through social sensing applications. Social
   sensing has emerged as a new application paradigm, where a crowd of
   social sources (humans or devices on their behalf) collectively
   contribute a large amount of observations about the physical world. This
   paper studies an interesting place finding problem, in which the goal is
   to correctly identify the interesting places in a city. Important
   challenges exist in solving this problem: (i) the interestingness of a
   place is not only related to the number of users who visit it, but also
   depends upon the travel experience of the visiting users; (ii) the
   user's social connections could directly affect their visiting behavior
   and the interestingness judgment of a given place. In this paper, we
   develop a new Social-aware Interesting Place Finding Plus (SIPF+)
   approach that addresses the above challenges by explicitly incorporating
   both the user's travel experience and social relationship into a
   rigorous analytical framework. The SIPF+ scheme can find interesting
   places not typically identified by traditional travel websites (e.g.,
   TripAdvisor, Expedia). We compare our solution with state-of-the-art
   baselines using two real-world datasets collected from location-based
   social network services and verified the effectiveness of our approach.

AB With the rapid development of location-based social networks (LBSNs),
   spatial item recommendation has become an important mobile application,
   especially when users travel away from home. However, this type of
   recommendation is very challenging compared to traditional recommender
   systems. A user may visit only a limited number of spatial items,
   leading to a very sparse user-item matrix. This matrix becomes even
   sparser when the user travels to a distant place, as most of the items
   visited by a user are usually located within a short distance from the
   user's home. Moreover, user interests and behavior patterns may vary
   dramatically across different time and geographical regions. In light of
   this, we propose ST-SAGE, a spatial-temporal sparse additive generative
   model for spatial item recommendation in this article. ST-SAGE considers
   both personal interests of the users and the preferences of the crowd in
   the target region at the given time by exploiting both the co-occurrence
   patterns and content of spatial items. To further alleviate the
   data-sparsity issue, ST-SAGE exploits the geographical correlation by
   smoothing the crowd's preferences over a well-designed spatial index
   structure called the spatial pyramid. To speed up the training process
   of ST-SAGE, we implement a parallel version of themodel inference
   algorithm on the GraphLab framework. We conduct extensive experiments;
   the experimental results clearly demonstrate that ST-SAGE outperforms
   the state-of-the-art recommender systems in terms of recommendation
   effectiveness, model training efficiency, and online recommendation
   efficiency.

AB Human mobility has attracted lots of attention in the domain of wireless

   habits and depending on spacial aspect is a challenging problem. In this
   paper, we are interested in discovering communities of mobile users and
   studying how do communities provide accurate knowledge to analysis the
   different forms of human mobility. The basic idea of our work is to
   model the behaviour of users with strong social characteristics
   regarding the context of their location histories to explore a similar
   interest of people by mining their mobiles communities. The proposed
   analysis illustrates in what way a common interest of a group of
   individuals can create better understanding of human mobility. Realistic
   models based on these interest based communities can be the basis for
   applications as recommendation system or wireless networks management.

AB Background
   Valvular heart diseases (VHD) is very common in clinical practice and
   has became the subject of growing attention in the field of
   cardiovascular medicine. Our aim was to assess the prevalence and
   correlates of VHD in the general population in Xinjiang, China.
   Methods
   Using a 4-stage stratified cluster random sampling method, a total of
   14618 participants were recruited in the Cardiovascular Risk Survey
   (CRS) study. The participants' personal information, medical history
   were assessed by questionnaire. VHD was diagnosed by trans thoracic
   echocardiography. We carried out the statistical analysis utilizing SPSS
   Statistics version 19.0.
   Results
   In the total study group, VHD was observed in 1397 (9.65%) individuals.
   The prevalence rates of VHD in Han, Uygur and Kazak group are 13.51%,
   2.71% and 12.29% respectively. The prevalence rates of VHD increased
   strikingly with age (all P < 0.001). The results of multinomial
   regression analysis indicated that VHD were related to age in Han group,
   to age smoking and hypertension in Uygur group, to age and hypertension
   in Kazak group.
   Conclusion
   Our research provides a unique prevalence rate of VHD in Xinjiang
   natural population. The result suggests that VHD are notably common in
   this population (9.65%) and increase with age. There exists significant
   difference of prevalence rate between ethnics. The main risk factors of
   VHD are age, hypertension and smoking. Valvular heart diseases should be
   regarded as a serious and growing public-health problem.

AB Recently, advances in intelligent mobile device and positioning
   techniques have fundamentally enhanced social networks, which allows
   users to share their experiences, reviews, ratings, photos, check-ins,
   etc. The geographical information located by smart phone bridges the gap
   between physical and digital worlds. Location data functions as the
   connection between user's physical behaviors and virtual social networks
   structured by the smart phone or web services. We refer to these social
   networks involving geographical information as location-based social
   networks (LBSNs). Such information brings opportunities and challenges
   for recommender systems to solve the cold start, sparsity problem of
   datasets and rating prediction. In this paper, we make full use of the
   mobile users' location sensitive characteristics to carry out rating
   prediction. We mine: 1) the relevance between user's ratings and
   user-item geographical location distances, called as user-item
   geographical connection, 2) the relevance between users' rating
   differences and user-user geographical location distances, called as
   user-user geographical connection. It is discovered that humans' rating
   behaviors are affected by geographical location significantly. Moreover,
   three factors: user-item geographical connection, user-user geographical
   connection, and interpersonal interest similarity, are fused into a
   unified rating prediction model. We conduct a series of experiments on a
   real social rating network dataset Yelp. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing models.

AB Tourist trip design problems (TTDP) support tourists in creating trips
   composed of multiple points of interest (POIs) or other travel-related
   items. We present a novel approach to generate routes comprising
   different POIs with a reasonable routing for a short city trip. In our
   scenario, a user enters a start and an end point in a web application
   together with preferences and receives a walking route with interesting
   places to visit along the way. The place discovery is based on
   retrieving arbitrarily rated places from Foursquare, so it is not
   restricted to certain cities or regions. The developed scoring mechanism
   rates the level of interest of a POI and accounts for the number of
   places per category. Discovered places are then combined to a practical
   route using a constraint-free and a constraint-based version of our
   algorithm. The algorithms are based on Dijkstra's algorithm to find the
   shortest path in a graph. We show that Dijkstra's algorithm can be
   modified to find not only the shortest paths, but also trips that solve
   the TTDP by maximizing the entertainment for the user while respecting
   time and budget constraints. The solution has been implemented in a
   practical web application. We conducted a user study showing that our
   test users highly accepted the application. Improvement with regard to
   user preferences for place categories lead to additional benefits in
   terms of user satisfaction with the routing and the match with their
   preferences. Finally, we outline challenges for future work on TTDPs in
   this article.

AB Technologies are increasingly taking advantage of the explosion of
   social media (e.g., web searches, ad targeting, personalized geo-social
   recommendations, urban computing). Estimating the characteristics of
   users, or user profiling, is one of the key challenges for such
   technologies. This paper focuses on the important problem of
   automatically estimating social networking service (SNS) user authority
   with a given city, which can significantly improve location-based
   services and systems. The "authority" in our work measures a user's
   familiarity with a particular city. By analyzing users' social,
   temporal, and spatial behavior, we respectively propose and compare
   three models for user authority: a social-network-driven model,
   time-driven model, and location-driven model. Furthermore, we discuss
   the integration of these three models. Finally, by using these
   user-profiling models, we propose a new application for geo-social
   recommendations. In contrast to related studies, which focus on popular
   and famous points of interests (POIs), our models help discover obscure
   POIs that are not well known. Experimental evaluations and analysis on a
   real dataset collected from three cities demonstrate the performance of
   the proposed user-profiling models. To verify the effect of discovering
   obscure POIs, the proposed application was implemented to discover and
   explore obscure POIs in Kyoto, Japan.

AB Remote monitoring in a continuous manner is a key component of ambulance
   transports for patients with severe diseases. The measurements of the
   patients, e.g. their heart rate, temperature, level of glucose and many
   more, should constantly be reported to the hospital with expert doctors
   to give instructions to people in ambulance so that the patient survives
   on the way to hospital where more instruments and expert doctors are
   available in hand. In rural areas, the coverage of communication
   services are not sufficient for transmission of such signals, so the
   available bandwidth should be used in an efficient manner, or severe
   irreparable damages can be caused for the patient. The available
   bandwidth can come from different sources like satellite communication,
   2G/3G/4G communication from different carriers, or other wireless
   communications available for ambulances specifically. Given that the
   physiological states of a patient are of different priorities and that
   the different sources of communications have different bandwidths (and
   so different round trip time), an important issue is to schedule the
   right physiological state of the patient to the right communication
   channel, so that the cost incurred to the patient minimizes In this
   paper, we investigate the performance of different scheduling algorithms
   on our system model, and propose an adaptive communication scheme for
   remote monitoring of critically ill patients who are receiving ambulance
   transport in rural areas with poor communication coverage to minimize
   the instantaneous incurred damage to these patients.

AB Ubiquitous deployment of low-cost mobile positioning devices and the
   widespread use of high-speed wireless networks enable massive collection
   of large-scale trajectory data of individuals moving on road networks.
   Trajectory data mining finds numerous applications including
   understanding users' historical travel preferences and recommending
   places of interest to new visitors. Privacy-preserving trajectory mining
   is an important and challenging problem as exposure of sensitive
   location information in the trajectories can directly invade the
   location privacy of the users associated with the trajectories. In this
   paper, we propose a differentially private trajectory analysis algorithm
   for points-of-interest recommendation to users that aims at maximizing
   the accuracy of the recommendation results while protecting the privacy
   of the exposed trajectories with differential privacy guarantees. Our
   algorithm first transforms the raw trajectory dataset into a bipartite
   graph with nodes representing the users and the points-of-interest and
   the edges representing the visits made by the users to the locations,
   and then extracts the association matrix representing the bipartite
   graph to inject carefully calibrated noise to meet is an element
   of-differential privacy guarantees. A post-processing of the perturbed
   association matrix is performed to suppress noise prior to performing a
   Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) on the transformed data that
   generates an ordered list of recommended points-of interest. Extensive
   experiments on a real trajectory dataset show that our algorithm is
   efficient, scalable and demonstrates high recommendation accuracy while
   meeting the required differential privacy guarantees.

AB As a result of the vast amount of location data, and the variety of the
   location based social network types such as Facebook check-ins and
   Foursquare. Many questions raised to enhance the quality of these
   networks, one important question is, which activity is the user going
   to, we formulated this as the prediction of the next location semantics,
   or the category. This feature would help service providers, to
   personalize the marketing campaigns and to enhance other problems
   results, such as the next location prediction. In order to solve this
   task, we divided it into two subtasks; first, to develop a model for
   novelty prediction, second to use its results to predict the next
   location. The predication task considers two cases of prediction;
   regular places (visited before) and novel places (never visited before).
   The predication accuracy of the proposed approach yields high accuracy
   of 86.7%, for regular places and an accuracy of 38.4% for novel places.

AB We introduce a novel knowledge-based recommendation algorithm for
   leisure time information to be used in social networks, which enhances
   the state-of-the-art in this algorithm category by taking into account
   (a) qualitative aspects of the recommended places (restaurants, museums,
   tourist attractions etc.), such as price, service and atmosphere, (b)
   influencing factors between social network users, (c) the semantic and
   geographical distance between locations and (d) the semantic
   categorization of the places to be recommended. The combination of these
   features leads to more accurate and better user-targeted leisure time
   recommendations.

AB In recent years, the widespread of mobile devices has made easier and
   popular the activities of recording locations visited by users and of
   inferring their trajectories. The availability of such large amount of
   spatio-temporal data opens new challenges to automatically extract
   information and get valuable knowledge. The many aspects of this issue
   have aroused the interest of researchers in several areas, such as
   information retrieval, data mining, context-aware computing, security
   and privacy issues, urban planning, and transport management. Recently,
   there has been a strong interest in understanding how people move during
   their common daily activities in order to get information about their
   behaviors and habits. In this paper we describe considerable recent
   research works related to the analysis of mobile spatio-temporal data,
   focusing on the study of social habits and behaviors. We provide a
   general perspective on studies on human mobility by depicting and
   comparing methods and algorithms, highlighting some critical issues
   related to information extraction from spatio-temporal data, and future
   research directions.

AB The World Wide Web (WWW) and mobile devices have become an indispensable
   part of life in this time. The pervasiveness of location acquisition
   technologies like global positioning system (GPS) has enabled the
   convenient logging of the movement sequences of users using mobile
   devices. This work proposes a personalised tourist spot recommender
   system for mobile users using genetic algorithm (GA) for a situation
   when explicit user ratings for tourist spots are not available. Implicit
   ratings of users for tourist spots are mined using GPS trajectory logs.
   GA is used to evolve ratings of unvisited spots using implicit ratings.
   GPS trajectory dataset of 178 users collected by Microsoft Research
   Asia's GeoLife project is used for the purpose of evaluation and
   experiments. We emphasise that proposed approach is comparable with
   existing related approaches when compared in terms of average root mean
   squared error (RMSE) and provides focused, personalised and relevant
   recommendations.

AB Complementary to the fancy big data applications, networking for big
   data is an indispensable supporting platform for these applications in
   practice. This emerging research branch has gained extensive attention
   from both academia and industry in recent years. In this new territory,
   researchers are facing many unprecedented theoretical and practical
   challenges. We are therefore motivated to solicit the latest works in
   this area, aiming to pave a comprehensive and solid starting ground for
   interested readers. We first clarify the definition of networking for
   big data based on the cross disciplinary nature and integrated needs of
   the domain. Second, we present the current understanding of big data
   from different levels, including its formation, networking features,
   mathematical representations, and the networking technologies. Third, we
   discuss the challenges and opportunities from various perspectives in
   this hopeful field. We further summarize the lessons we learned based on
   the survey. We humbly hope this paper will shed light for forthcoming
   researchers to further explore the uncharted part of this promising
   land.

AB Conventional ways of trip planning using online reviews from multiple
   sources are often cumbersome and uncustomizable. The advance in
   information and communication technology (ICT) and the surge in
   user-generated contents (UGC) provide great opportunities to facilitate
   trip planning. This paper proposes a travel-planning tool by
   crowdsourcing multiple UGCs to provide customized information for
   tourists. We harvested hotel customer reviews from TripAdvisor, photo
   information from Flickr, and travel costs between destinations from
   Uber. First, we used geospatial data mining approaches to extract
   tourism attractions information from Flickr; identified multi-facet
   characteristics of hotels with natural language processing (NLP); and
   provided travel route recommendations with graph analysis. Second, we
   developed a web-based interface to let users communicate with the system
   interactively, which provides integrated recommendations including
   attractions, hotels, and visit route sequences. Two cities in the United
   States (i.e. Atlanta and Chicago) were used as cases to illustrate our
   approaches. The proposed travel planning tool is not only beneficial to
   support customized travel decision-making, but also supportive for hotel
   managers with strategic management implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
