AB The discovery of movement patterns from trajectory data is crucial for
   supporting many location-based applications. Most existing methods
   require that the trajectories contain explicit location information.
   However, it is usually difficult to collect such kind of trajectories
   from mobile phone users. In this paper, we propose a method for mining
   movement patterns from cell-id trajectories (i.e., sequences of cell
   tower identifiers) without explicit location information. Specifically,
   we firstly estimate the spatial closeness between cell towers in a
   cell-id trajectory dataset by exploiting the handoff features. Then, we
   propose a novel sequential pattern mining algorithm to mine movement
   patterns from the cell-id trajectory dataset by taking into account the
   estimated spatial closeness. We evaluated the proposed method based on a
   real cell-id trajectory dataset. The experiment results show that the
   proposed method can adapt to the high uncertainty of cell-id
   trajectories and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
   efficiency, completeness, and usefulness. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Many cities have provided public bicycle services to reduce traffic
   congestion and air pollution. Mobility of public bicycles makes them
   very suitable for event-driven sensing for smart cities, i.e.,
   collecting data relevant to special events such as car accidents or
   street parades. The problem is how to assign a set of bicycles to best
   fulfil the sensing mission, considering the constrained storage, battery
   energy, and communication capability of bicycles. The problem is
   referred to as the resource-constrained task assignment for event-driven
   sensing (ReConTAES). The goal is to minimise the number of bicycles
   used, while balancing the energy consumption of the selected bicycles.
   We first formulate the problem as a mixed integer programming and then
   propose a set of greedy heuristics to solve the problem. We evaluate the
   proposed algorithms by using real trajectories to show their
   feasibility.

AB The use of web services for analysing and visualising maps has received
   great attention recently, because the complicated analysis of spatial
   data requires different processes to be run consecutively. Predicting
   the future location of a vehicle on a street network is one of the most
   challenging analyses used for improving context-aware location-based
   services, intelligent transportation systems and criminology. In this
   research, the authors present a new short-term prediction algorithm and
   explore the required analyses and web services. They present an
   appropriate method for chaining these web services to predict
   location(s). To assess their methodology, they developed a prototype
   system and tested for trajectories in Beijing. This system calculates
   the prediction time for a specified car to show the predicted future
   location in the street network. Their results showed that the average
   transferred data volume increases as the prediction period increases.
   The results also showed that the prediction algorithm has 75% accuracy
   at 1 min and 87.5% accuracy at 2 and 3 min. The implemented chaining
   method reduces the complexity of the location prediction algorithm for
   users because they do not need to know the processes. The outputs from
   this system can be used as input parameters for other web-based
   applications.

AB The prediction of the destination location at the time of pickup is an
   important problem with potential for substantial impact on the
   efficiency of a GPS-enabled taxi service. While this problem has been
   explored earlier in the batch data set-up, we propose in this paper new
   solutions in the streaming data set-up. We examine four incremental
   learning methods using a damped window model namely, Multivariate
   multiple regression, Spherical-spherical regression, Randomized
   spherical K-NN regression and an Ensemble of these methods for their
   effectiveness in solving the destination prediction problem. The
   performance of these methods on several large datasets are evaluated
   using suitably chosen metrics and they were also compared with some
   other existing methods. We found that the Multivariate multiple
   regression method has the best performance in terms of prediction
   accuracy but the Spherical-spherical regression method is the best
   performer when we take into account the accuracy time trade-off
   criterion. The next pickup location problem, where we are interested in
   predicting the next pickup location for a taxi given the dropoff
   location coordinates of the previous trip as input is also considered
   and the aforementioned methods are examined for their suitability using
   real world datasets. As in the case of destination prediction problem,
   here also we find that the Multivariate multiple regression method gives
   better performance than the rest when we consider prediction accuracy
   but the Spherical-spherical regression method is the best performer when
   the accuracy-time trade-off criterion is taken into account.

AB With the accumulation of the vast amount of location data acquired by
   positioning devices embedded in mobile phones and cars, position
   prediction of moving objects has been an important research direction
   for many location-based services such as public transit forecasting and
   tourist behavior analysis. In this paper, a position prediction system
   has been proposed, which utilizes not only spatial but also temporal
   regularity of object mobility. Historical trajectory data of the object
   is used to extract personal trajectory patterns to obtain candidate next
   positions. Each of the candidate next positions is scored by the
   proposed Spatio-Temporal Regularity-based Prediction (STRP) algorithm
   according to time components of patterns and current time. The position
   with the highest score is considered as the predicted next position.
   Furthermore, a hybrid B/S and C/S architecture is employed to perform
   the real-time prediction and results display. An evaluation based on two
   different public trajectory data sets demonstrates that the proposed
   STRP algorithm achieves highly accurate position prediction. Moreover,
   the average accuracy rate of our prediction algorithm with one known
   position is about 86.8%, which is 43.9% better than the Markov-based
   algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Personal mobility data can nowadays be easily collected by personal
   mobile phones and used for analytical modeling. To assist in such an
   analysis, a variety of computational approaches have been developed. The
   goal is to extract mobility patterns in order to provide traveling
   assistance, information, recommendations or on-demand services. While
   various computational techniques are being developed, research
   literature on destination and route prediction lacks consistency in
   evaluation methods for such approaches. This study presents a review and
   categorization of evaluation criteria and terminology used in assessing
   the performance of such methods. The review is complemented by
   experimental analysis of selected evaluation criteria, to highlight the
   nuances existing between the evaluation measures. The experimental study
   uses previously unpublished mobility data of 15 users collected over a
   period of 6 months in Helsinki metropolitan area in Finland. The article
   is primarily intended for researchers developing approaches for
   personalized mobility analysis, as well as a guideline for practitioners
   to select criteria when assessing and selecting between computational
   approaches. Our main recommendation is to consider user-specific
   accuracy measures in addition to averaged aggregates, as well as to take
   into consideration that for many users accuracy does not saturate fast
   and the performance keeps evolving over time. Therefore, we recommend
   using time-weighted measures. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB With the increasing use of private vehicles with positioning services,
   GPS trajectory data of vehicles has become one of the major sources of
   big data about urban life. Existing studies on mobility pattern mining
   from trajectories share a common limitation, i.e., they fail to capture
   the semantics of trajectories. Automatic derivation of semantic
   information for every trajectory is a challenging task. In this paper,
   we propose an approach, called SMOPAT (Semantic MObility PATterns), for
   mining spatial-temporal semantic mobility patterns from trajectories of
   private vehicles. We design a probabilistic generative model with latent
   variables to characterize the semantic mobility of vehicles. Based on
   the model, SMOPAT labels each location in a trajectory with a visit
   purpose by using a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm. It
   then employs an efficient algorithm to find the most frequent semantic
   mobility patterns. We evaluate our approach on a large data set of real
   trajectories of private vehicles spanning a time duration of over ten
   months with 114 million records in Shanghai, China. The experimental
   results show that our approach produces meaningful patterns and
   outperforms the two competing methods in terms of diversity, coherence,
   and coverage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, as location-based social networks (LBSNs) rapidly grow,
   general users utilize point-of-interest recommender systems to discover
   attractive locations. Most existing POI recommendation algorithms always
   employ the check-in data and rich contextual information (e. g.,
   geographical information and users' social network information) of users
   to learn their preference on POIs. Unfortunately, these studies
   generally suffer from two major limitations: (1) when modeling
   geographical influence, users' personalized behavior differences are
   ignored; (2) when modeling the users' social influence, the implicit
   social influence is seldom exploited. In this paper, we propose a novel
   POI recommendation approach called GeoEISo. GeoEISo achieves three key
   goals in this work. (1) We develop a kernel estimation method with a
   selfadaptive kernel bandwidth to model the geographical influence
   between POIs. (2) We use the Gaussian radial basis kernel function based
   support vector regression (SVR) model to predict explicit trust values
   between users, and then devise a novel trust-based recommendation model
   to simultaneously incorporate both the explicit and implicit social
   trust information into the process of POI recommendation. (3) We develop
   a unified geo-social framework which combines users' preference on a POI
   with the geographical influence as well as social correlations.
   Experimental results on two real-world datasets collected from
   Foursquare show that GeoEISo provides significantly superior
   performances compared to other state-of-the-art POI recommendation
   models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most of us live our daily lives in various types of indoor environments.
   With the rapidly increasing air pollution and abnormal weather
   conditions occurring all over the world, the importance of indoor space
   is expected to increase in the future. As the importance of indoor
   spaces has increased, there have been extensive efforts to understand
   the indoor behavior patterns of individuals by collecting and analyzing
   their indoor positioning data. However, indiscriminate collection of
   indoor location information may raise significant privacy issues,
   because it is possible to infer sensitive information by analyzing their
   indoor location data. Thus, there is a need to develop a technology
   capable of: 1) collecting individuals' indoor positioning data while not
   violating privacy requirements and 2) analyzing their movement patterns,
   based on the indoor positioning data set collected in a
   privacy-preserving manner. Recently, there has been a growing interest
   in local difference privacy (LDP) that can protect individual privacy in
   the process of data collection. The main concept of LDP is adding
   carefully designed noise to sensitive data at the data contributor's
   side and directly sending the noisy data to a data collector,
   guaranteeing that the original data are not exposed to the outside. In
   this paper, we first develop a method to collect individuals' indoor
   positioning information by leveraging LDP, and then, we introduce an
   effective approach to compute top-k routes between two points in indoor
   environments by leveraging the indoor positioning data sets collected in
   an LDP manner. Experimental results show that the proposed approach well
   exploits the indoor positioning data collected in an LDP-compliant
   manner, and a good estimation of top-k routes can be achieved with the
   proposed method and a large data set.

AB Moving route prediction offers important benefits for many emerging
   location-aware applications such as target advertising and urban traffic
   management. A common approach to route prediction is to match similar
   trace recordings from a larger volume of historical trajectories, and
   return the targeted recorded path as desired answer. However, due to
   privacy concerns, incentive mechanism and other reasons, especially in
   small business environment, a limited dataset with sparse trajectories
   is only available. Actually, the existing sparse dataset cannot cover
   sufficient query routes, and then the match-based approach may return no
   results at all. Moreover, the existing sparse dataset may fail many
   trajectory mining approaches that work well on general environment. In
   this paper, we investigate moving route prediction from sparse
   trajectory dataset, and propose a novel hybrid model, namely HMRP, to
   address the above problem. To avoid sparse distribution over spatial
   semantic layer, a road network map reconstruction methods are proposed
   to accommodate the sparse trajectories in semantic transformation. And
   then, by training historical trajectories, the implicit mobility
   patterns and Markov transition model are constructed to support route
   prediction. When a query trajectory arrives, towards its derived
   potential destination, our proposed HMRP model integrates pattern
   matching strategy and Markov probability distribution to predict its
   future route gradually in a complementary way. Experiments on real-life
   taxicab GPS recorded dataset demonstrate that HMRP method can improve
   movement prediction precision significantly, comparing with the baseline
   prediction algorithms. And the response time for each query trajectory
   is acceptable for most application cases.

AB Frequent route pattern mining from personal trajectory data is the basis
   of location awareness and location services. However, because personal
   trajectory data is highly uncertain, most existing approaches are only
   capable of finding short and incomplete route patterns. In this paper, a
   novel approach is proposed for the discovery of frequent route patterns
   based on trajectory abstraction. First, trajectory partition, location
   extraction, data simplification, and common segment discovery are used
   to abstract trajectory data, convert these trajectories into common
   segment temporal sequences (STS) and generate 1-frequent itemsets. Then,
   a pattern mining algorithm is proposed based on the spatial-temporal
   adjacency relationship. This algorithm uses the constraint mechanism and
   bidirectional projected database to mine frequent route patterns from
   STS. Based on the real GeoLife trajectory data, the experimental results
   indicate that the proposed method has better performance and can find
   longer route patterns than other currently available methods.

   learning environments and efficient input interfaces. This study
   combined a context-aware mechanism, which can be used to provide
   suitable learning information anytime and anyplace by using GPS
   technology, with a rapid and user-friendly QR code interface input into
   a personalized context-aware recommendation (PCAR) learning system for
   enabling learners to immediately save useful external contents as
   learning materials. To improve students' English application abilities
   efficiently, GPS combined with an intelligent personalized context-aware
   learning algorithm was used to obtain English learning content that is
   more practical. The results of several experiments and investigations
   indicate that the posttest grades of the experimental group, which used
   the proposed PCAR system, were higher than those of the control group.
   Furthermore, approximately 80 percent of the users were satisfied with
   how the system benefited their learning and with its ease of use. The
   results also show that the PCAR system markedly enhanced learner
   interest and learning efficiency by creating a convenient virtual
   English learning environment.

AB Low-cost GPS (receiver) has become a ubiquitous and integral part of our
   daily life. Despite noticeable advantages such as being cheap, small,
   light, and easy to use, its limited positioning accuracy devalues and
   hampers its wide applications for reliable mapping and analysis. Two
   conventional techniques to remove outliers in a GPS trajectory are
   thresholding and Kalman-based methods, which are difficult in selecting
   appropriate thresholds and modeling the trajectories. Moreover, they are
   insensitive to medium and small outliers, especially for low-sample-rate
   trajectories. This paper proposes a model-based GPS trajectory cleaner.
   Rather than examining speed and acceleration or assuming a
   pre-determined trajectory model, we first use cubic smooth spline to
   adaptively model the trend of the trajectory. The residuals, i.e., the
   differences between the trend and GPS measurements, are then further
   modeled by time series method. Outliers are detected by scoring the
   residuals at every GPS trajectory point. Comparing to the conventional
   procedures, the trend-residual dual modeling approach has the following
   features: (a) it is able to model trajectories and detect outliers
   adaptively; (b) only one critical value for outlier scores needs to be
   set; (c) it is able to robustly detect unapparent outliers; and (d) it
   is effective in cleaning outliers for GPS trajectories with low sample
   rates. Tests are carried out on three real-world GPS trajectories
   datasets. The evaluation demonstrates an average of 9.27 times better
   performance in outlier detection for GPS trajectories than thresholding
   and Kalman-based techniques.

AB The proliferation of GPS enabled devices has led people to share
   locations both consciously and unconsciously. Large spatio-temporal data
   comprising of shared locations and whereabouts are now being routinely
   collected for analysis. As user movements are generally driven by their
   interests, so mining these mobility patterns can reveal commonalities
   between a pair of users. In this paper, we present a framework for
   mining the published trajectories to identify patterns in user mobility.
   In this framework, we extract the locations where a user stays for a
   period of time popularly known as stay points. These stay points help to
   identify the interests of a user. The statistics of pattern and check-in
   distributions over the GPS data are used to formulate similarity
   measures for finding K-nearest neighbors of an active user. In this
   work, we categorize the neighbors into three groups namely strongly
   similar, closely similar and weakly similar. We introduce three
   similarity measures to determine them, one for each of the categories.
   We perform experiments on a real-world GPS log data to find the
   similarity scores between a pair of users and subsequently find the
   effective K-neighbors. Experimental results show that our proposed
   metric outperforms existing metrics in literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   of multiple uses of mobile data published in the scientific literature.
   The organization of the survey follows a typology built on two criteria:
   interaction level and focus of analysis. Crossing these two dimensions
   would suggest 8 research areas. Only 4 of them are actually covered by
   the collected pieces of work. They are discussed in turn showing off the
   main characteristics of them. Finally, the discussion of the 4 remaining
   areas highlights new research areas with a special focus on the
   possibility to use mobile data to influence individual users towards
   efficient collective behaviors. To conclude, current and future research
   avenues suggest that mobile devices and their underlying data are likely
   to be employed in many domains and may be used not only to observe human
   life but also to influence it.

AB Frequent route is an important individual outdoor behavior pattern that
   many trajectory-based applications rely on. In this paper, we propose a
   novel framework for extracting frequent routes from personal GPS
   trajectories. The key idea of our design is to accurately detect road
   corners and utilize these new metaphors to tackle the problem of
   frequent route extraction. Concretely, our framework contains three
   phases: 1) characteristic point (CP) extraction; 2) corner detection;
   and 3) trajectory mapping. In the first phase, we present a linear
   fitting-based algorithm to extract CPs. In the second phase, we develop
   a multiple density level DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of
   applications with noise) algorithm to locate road corners by clustering
   CPs. In the third phase, we convert each trajectory into an ordered
   sequence of road corners and obtain all routes that have been traversed
   by an individual for at least F (frequency threshold) times. We evaluate
   the framework using real-world trajectory datasets of individuals for
   one year and the experimental results demonstrate that our framework
   outperforms the baseline approach by 7.8% on average in terms of
   precision and 21.9% in terms of recall.

AB We study the problem of learning individual route preferences of
   drivers. Most current route planning services only compute shortest or
   quickest paths. But many other criteria might play a role for a user to
   prefer a certain route, as, e.g., fuel consumption, jam likeliness, road
   conditions, scenicness of the route, turns, allowed maximum speeds, toll
   costs and many more. Specifying the importance of each criterion
   manually is a non-trivial, unintuitive and time consuming undertaking
   for a user. Therefore, we develop approaches that deduce such
   preferences automatically based on paths previously driven by the user.
   We present an LP-formulation of the problem making use of a
   Dijkstra-based separation oracle. The resulting algorithm runs in
   polynomial time and allows for the user preference computation in few
   seconds even if several hundred routes are taken into account. Our
   experiments show that new route suggestions based on these learned
   preferences reflect the users definition of an optimal route very well.

AB Next location prediction has been an essential task for many location
   based applications such as targeted advertising. In this paper, we
   present three basic models to tackle the problem of predicting next
   locations: the Global Markov Model that uses all available trajectories
   to discover global behaviors, the Personal Markov Model that focuses on
   mining the individual patterns of each moving object, and the Regional
   Markov Model that clusters the trajectories to mine the similar movement
   patterns. The three models are integrated with linear regression in
   different ways. We then seek to further improve the accuracy of
   prediction by considering the time factor, with a focus on clustering
   the trajectories in different time periods, and present three methods to
   train the time-aware models to mine periodic patterns. Therefore, our
   proposed models have the following advantages: (1) we consider both
   individual and collective movement patterns in making prediction, (2) we
   consider the similarity between different trajectories, (3) we consider
   the time factor and build models that are suited to different time
   periods. We have conducted extensive experiments on a real dataset, and

AB Abstract In Brazil there is the perspective of significant growth in the
   volume of data being processed by vehicle tracking services companies as
   a result of natural increase in the use of tracking systems. This growth
   generates the need for the incorporation of analytical tools in the
   management of vehicle tracking systems and risk managing, in order to
   increase their efficiency and cater to the market growth. This paper
   aims to develop a model for identifying the Spatial Behavior Patterns of
   Monitoring Vehicles (SBPMV) using a spatial analysis tool to aid the
   process of decision making in vehicle monitoring and the urban
   transportation system management. Although the results obtained are
   valid for the particular configuration presented in this article, the
   proposed methodological analysis allows the characterization of spatial
   patterns of vehicle movements in the study area during the considered
   period, which is useful, for instance, for city planners, enterprise
   logistics and insurance companies. The conclusion is that the result of
   the comparison between the collected real-time positioning data with the
   spatial distribution model obtained through the characterization of the
   spatial behavior patterns is able to detect abnormalities in the vehicle
   movement behavior and provide subsidies to decision-making process for
   vehicle monitoring and management systems, which aim the patrimonial and
   personal safety, and the identification of unexpected movement or risky
   behaviors.
Y4 Resumo No Brasil existe a perspectiva de crescimento expressivo do
   volume de dados a ser processado pelas prestadoras de serviços de
   rastreamento de veículos em decorrência do aumento natural do uso de
   sistemas de rastreamento. Esse crescimento gera a necessidade da
   incorporação de ferramentas analíticas nos sistemas de gerenciamento do
   rastreamento e monitoramento de veículos e na gestão de risco, para
   aumentar a sua eficiência e atender ao crescimento do mercado. O
   presente estudo tem como objetivo o desenvolvimento de um modelo para
   identificação do Padrão de Comportamento Espacial de Veículos em
   Movimento – PCEVM, utilizando uma ferramenta de análise espacial para
   auxiliar o processo de tomada de decisão no monitoramento de veículos e
   na gestão do sistema de transporte urbano. Embora os resultados obtidos
   sejam válidos para a particular configuração apresentada neste artigo, a
   metodologia de análise proposta permite a caracterização de padrões
   espaciais de movimentação de veículos na área e no período considerados,
   o que é útil, por exemplo, para planejadores municipais, empresas de
   logística e empresas seguradoras. Conclui-se que o resultado da
   comparação entre o posicionamento coletado em tempo real com o modelo de
   distribuição espacial obtido na caracterização dos padrões de
   comportamento espaciais é capaz de detectar anormalidades do
   comportamento de movimentação do veículo e oferecer subsídios para a
   tomada de decisão em sistemas de monitoramento e gerenciamento de
   veículos, que visem à segurança patrimonial e pessoal, identificando
   comportamentos de movimentação não esperados ou de comportamentos de
   risco.

AB Under the traditional method of frequent trajectory mining, the location
   of data is obtained through the GPS device. However, limited equipment
   accuracy may incur location ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a new
   trajectory data clustering method based on dynamic grid density, in
   order to remove this ambiguity. In this method, the trajectory space of
   an object is firstly divided into equal-sized squares dynamically Then
   the trajectories of object are mapped to their corresponding square.
   Next, the density of each grid is calculated and all the frequent
   squares are acquired given the minimum support threshold. Lastly, the
   frequent area is obtained by merging the frequent squares acquired
   previously, using the boundary function provided. The experimental
   results show that this method provides an optional way of finding the

AB Roaming, referring to the behavior of repeated observation of intended
   crime scenes before committing crimes, is a suspicious pattern often
   mentioned by experienced police investigators, but still remains a vague
   concept which needs to be well realized in video surveillance systems.
   This work first describes the scenario of roaming behaviors related to
   planned crimes, and then derives formal specifications for detecting
   suspicious roaming events from vehicle trajectories. Consequently,
   algorithms are designed for rapidly sorting out potential outliers and
   thoroughly examining their suspicious intention through circling
   activities, relative driving speed and time dispersion. Roaming
   trajectories and relevant trajectories are finally grouped into events
   and appropriately ranked. Furthermore, preliminary experiments and
   illustrative examples on synthetic data demonstrate the feasibility of
   our methods. The proposed approach enhances conventional vehicle plate
   analysis so that it becomes capable of discovering complex criminal
   behaviors and hence increasing investigation performance and decision
   quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With the rapid growth of location-based social networks (LBSNs),
   location recommendations play an important role in shaping the life of
   individuals. Fortunately, a variety of community-contributed data, such
   as geographical information, social friendships and residence
   information, enable us to mine users' reality and infer their
   preferences on locations. In this paper, we propose an effective and
   efficient location recommendation framework called CoRe. CoRe achieves
   three key goals in this work. (1) We model a personalized check-in
   probability density over the two-dimensional geographic coordinates for
   each user. (2) We propose an efficient approximation approach to predict
   the probability of a user visiting a new location using her personalized
   check-in probability density. (3) We develop a new method to measure the
   similarity between users based on their social friendship and residence
   information, and then devise a fusion rule to integrate the geographical
   influence with the social influence so as to improve the user preference
   model on location recommendations. Finally, we conduct extensive
   experiments to evaluate the recommendation accuracy, recommendation
   efficiency and approximation error of CoRe using two large-scale real
   data sets collected from two popular LBSNs: Foursquare and Gowalla.
   Experimental results show that CoRe achieves significantly superior
   performance compared to other state-of-the-art geo-social recommendation
   techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   system that is used to alert the user for potential mistakes in his
   path, anticipating possible shifts in the wrong direction in critical
   points of the route. With this module, it becomes possible to issue
   warnings to the user and increase his attention so as to avoid a
   deviation from the correct path.

   become instrumental to provide new urban services. In this context, many
   proposals applied an off-line learning on historical data. However, at

   work introduces a novel approach for online mobility model detection
   along with a new concept for trajectory abstraction based on velocity
   features. Finally, the proposal is evaluated with a real-world dataset.

AB Next location prediction is of great importance for many location based
   applications. In many cases, understanding the similarity between
   objects and the similarity between trajectories may lead to more
   accurate predictions. In this paper, we propose two novel models
   exploiting these two types of similarities respectively. The first
   model, named object-clustered Markov model (object-MM), first clusters
   similar objects based on their spatial localities, and then builds
   variable-order Markov models with the trajectories of objects in the
   same cluster. The second model, named trajectory-clustered Markov model
   (tra-MM), considers the similarity between trajectories, and clusters
   the trajectories to form the training set used in building the Markov
   models. The two models are integrated to produce the final next location
   predictor (objectTra-MM). Experiments based on a real data set
   demonstrate significant increase in prediction accuracy of objectTra-MM
   over existing methods.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged and several issues have arisen
   in the area such as sensor registration and management, semantic
   interpretation and processing, and sensor searching and filtering in
   Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Also, as the number of sensors in an
   IoT environment increases significantly, sensor filtering becomes more
   important. Many sensor filtering techniques have been researched.
   However most of them do not consider real-time searching and efficiency
   of mobile networks. In this paper, we suggest a path prediction approach
   for effective sensor filtering in Sensor Registry System (SRS). SRS is a
   sensor platform to register and manage sensor information for sensor
   filtering. We also propose a method for learning and predicting user
   paths based on the Collective Behavior Pattern. To improve prediction
   accuracy, we consider a time feature to measure weights and predict a
   path. We implement the method and the implementation and its evaluation
   confirm the improvement of time and accuracy for processing sensor

   specifies the path of the movement of any object. There is an increase

   which needs to know the location of moving objects where trajectory
   mining plays a vital role. Trajectory mining techniques use the
   geographical location, semantics, and properties of the moving object to
   predict the location and behavior of the object. This paper analyses the
   various strategies in the process of making prediction of future
   location and constructing the trajectory pattern. The analyses of
   various mechanisms are done based on various factors including accuracy
   and ability to predict the distant future. Location prediction problem
   can be with known reference points and unknown reference points, and

AB Geo-tagged photos of users on social media sites (e.g., Flickr) provide
   plentiful location-based data. This data provide a wealth of information
   about user behaviours and their potential is increasing, as it becomes
   ever-more common for images to be associated with location information
   in the form of geo-tags. Recently, there is an increasing tendency to
   adopt the information from these geo-tagged photos for learning to
   recommend tourist locations. In this paper, we aim to propose a system
   to recommend interesting tourist locations and interesting tourist
   travel sequences (i.e., sequence of tourist locations) from a collection
   of geotagged photos. Proposed system is capable of understanding context
   (i.e., time, date, and weather), as well as taking into account the
   collective wisdom of people, to make tourist recommendations. We
   illustrate our technique on a sample of public Flickr data set.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to
   generate better recommendations as compared to other state-of-the-art
   landmark based recommendation methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The discovery of route patterns from trajectory data generated by moving
   objects is an essential problem for location-aware computing. However,
   the high degree of uncertainty of personal trajectory data significantly
   disturbs the existing route pattern mining approaches, and results in
   finding only short and incomplete patterns with high computational
   complexity. In this paper, we propose a personal trajectory data mining
   framework, which includes a group-and-partition trajectory abstraction
   technique and a frequent pattern mining algorithm called SCPM (Spatial
   Continuity based Pattern Mining). The group-and-partition technique can
   discover common sub-segments which are used to abstract the original
   trajectory data. The SCPM algorithm can efficiently derive longer and
   more complete route patterns from the abstracted personal trajectory
   data by tolerating various kinds of disturbances during the trips. Based
   on the real-world personal trajectory data, we conducted a number of
   experiments to evaluate the performance of our framework. The
   experimental results demonstrate that our framework is more efficient
   and effective as compared with the existing route pattern mining
   approaches, and the extracted route patterns can be effectively utilized
   to predict users' future route.

AB To support an efficient carpooling service in heavy urban traffic, we
   propose an intelligent routing scheme based on mining Global Position
   System trajectories from shared riders. The carpooling system provides
   many-to-many services with multiple pickup and dropping points. To join
   a daily carpooling group, the riders must accept a compromised route
   that is efficient after merging the routes that are preferred by all
   qualified riders. We developed three frequency-correlated algorithms for
   route mining, rider selection, and route merging in an urban carpool
   service. Our approach can cope with the traffic dynamics to yield a
   suboptimal shared route. Our scheme was successfully tested under heavy
   Beijing traffic over hundreds of riders. We developed performance
   metrics to measure the service cost and mileage saved. The ultimate goal
   is to minimize the riding distances and the transportation costs, and
   thus alleviate urban traffic jams.

   a lot of operations between users and smartphones are needed, such as
   destination setting, options setting and zooming in/out. Potential
   dangers may bring to the users when they are walking on the street or
   especially driving. In this paper, we study providing an automatical
   navigation system, in which the number of users' operations is largely
   reduced. The navigation system can automatically predict user's future
   possible destinations and routes without any operation from users. The
   prediction is performed by analyzing both user's current position and
   historical tracing data. We implement the proposed system on the Android
   platform. The experimental results show that the application works
   effectively to provide anticipated routes and destinations for a single
   user.

   information about movement costs to detect reasonable movements, but we
   do not expect theoretical optimal paths. We are able to model different
   efficiency goals and different degrees of optimality. We present an

   predict users' future routes by collecting their daily trajectory data.
   Then it delivers a reminding message via the mobile phone when it senses
   that the user is going to the task location. A field study was conducted
   on how iReminder extends its potential to help users perform everyday
   tasks and compared the method adopted by iReminder with the method used
   by traditional location-based reminders. The experimental results show
   that iReminder outperforms traditional location-based reminder because
   it delivers reminding messages more appropriately. A detailed discussion
   is also given to investigate the ideal message delivery point, and the
   discussion results show that a location-based reminding message is more
   useful and more likely to be accepted by the user if it is triggered by
   considering his or her future route.

AB Ubiquitous computing software needs to be autonomous so that essential
   decisions such as how to configure its particular execution are
   self-determined. Moreover, data mining serves an important role for
   ubiquitous computing by providing intelligence to several types of
   ubiquitous computing applications. Thus, automating ubiquitous data
   mining is also crucial. We focus on the problem of automatically
   configuring the execution of a ubiquitous data mining algorithm. In our
   solution, we generate configuration decisions in a resource aware and
   context aware manner since the algorithm executes in an environment in
   which the context often changes and computing resources are often
   severely limited. We propose to analyze the execution behavior of the
   data mining algorithm by mining its past executions. By doing so, we
   discover the effects of resource and context states as well as parameter
   settings on the data mining quality. We argue that a classification
   model is appropriate for predicting the behavior of an algorithm's
   execution and we concentrate on decision tree classifier. We also define
   taxonomy on data mining quality so that tradeoff between prediction
   accuracy and classification specificity of each behavior model that
   classifies by a different abstraction of quality, is scored for model
   selection. Behavior model constituents and class label transformations
   are formally defined and experimental validation of the proposed
   approach is also performed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Mobility data has attracted the researchers for the past few years
   because of its rich context and spatiotemporal nature, where this
   information can be used for potential applications like early warning
   system, route prediction, traffic management, advertisement, social
   networking, and community finding. All the mentioned applications are
   based on mobility profile building and user trend analysis, where
   mobility profile building is done through significant places extraction,
   user's actual movement prediction, and context awareness. However,
   significant places extraction and user's actual movement prediction for
   mobility profile building are a trivial task. In this paper, we present
   the user similarity mining-based methodology through user mobility
   profile building by using the semantic tagging information provided by
   user and basic GSM network architecture properties based on unsupervised
   clustering approach. As the mobility information is in low-level raw
   form, our proposed methodology successfully converts it to a high-level
   meaningful information by using the cell-Id location information rather
   than previously used location capturing methods like GPS, Infrared, and
   Wifi for profile mining and user similarity mining.

AB Individuals tend to follow their own preferred paths when traveling to

   various intelligent LBSs. In order to predict a current user's route,
   various approaches have been researched. In this paper, we suggest a
   practical approach to learning users' route patterns from their
   histories and using that information to predict specific routes. In
   cases where existing routes overlap, i.e., where parts of routes are the
   same, in a user's route model, it is difficult to identify the user's
   intended path. For more accurate prediction, firstly, we extract route
   patterns by adopting image processing. Secondly, we build a
   state-observation model reflecting users' intentions, based on route
   patterns, temporal features and weather information. Our approach
   consist of four steps: recognizing regions for splitting routes into
   trip segments, route pattern mining, learning users' route models and
   trip route prediction. Our method achieved a prediction accuracy of
   96.4% in tests performed with 15 smartphone users.

   structure, called the bit-vector R-tree (bR-tree), which stores
   additional bit-vector information to describe non-spatial attribute
   values of the data objects. In addition, each node in the bR-tree stores
   only one pointer to its children, which makes the bR-tree compact. We
   generate the broadcast stream by multiplexing the bR-tree and the data
   objects in the broadcasting channel. The corresponding search algorithm
   for the broadcast stream is also described. Through a series of
   comprehensive simulation experiments, we prove the efficiency of the
