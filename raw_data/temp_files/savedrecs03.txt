TI Semantic trajectory-based high utility item recommendation system
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB The topic on recommendation systems for mobile users has attracted a lot of attentions in recent years. However, most of the existing recommendation techniques were developed based only on geographic features of mobile users' trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for recommending items for mobile users based on both the geographic and semantic features of users' trajectories. The core idea of our recommendation system is based on a novel cluster-based location prediction strategy, namely TrajUtiRec, to improve items recommendation model. Our proposed cluster-based location prediction strategy evaluates the next location of a mobile user based on the frequent behaviors of similar users in the same cluster determined by analyzing users' common behaviors in semantic trajectories. For each location, high utility itemset mining algorithm is performed for discovering high utility itemset. Accordingly, we can recommend the high utility itemset which is related to the location the user might visit. Through a comprehensive evaluation by experiments, our proposal is shown to deliver excellent performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Object-Oriented Travel Package Recommendation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Providing better travel services for tourists is one of the important applications in urban computing. Though many recommender systems have been developed for enhancing the quality of travel service, most of them lack a systematic and open framework to dynamically incorporate multiple types of additional context information existing in the tourism domain, such as the travel area, season, and price of travel packages. To that end, in this article, we propose an open framework, the Objected-Oriented Recommender System (ORS), for the developers performing personalized travel package recommendations to tourists. This framework has the ability to import all the available additional context information to the travel package recommendation process in a cost-effective way. Specifically, the different types of additional information are extracted and uniformly represented as feature-value pairs. Then, we define the Object, which is the collection of the feature-value pairs. We propose two models that can be used in the ORS framework for extracting the implicit relationships among Objects. The Objected-Oriented Topic Model (OTM) can extract the topics conditioned on the intrinsic feature-value pairs of the Objects. The Objected-Oriented Bayesian Network (OBN) can effectively infer the cotravel probability of two tourists by calculating the co-occurrence time of feature-value pairs belonging to different kinds of Objects. Based on the relationships mined by OTM or OBN, the recommendation list is generated by the collaborative filtering method. Finally, we evaluate these two models and the ORS framework on real-world travel package data, and the experimental results show that the ORS framework is more flexible in terms of incorporating additional context information, and thus leads to better performances for travel package recommendations. Meanwhile, for feature selection in ORS, we define the feature information entropy, and the experimental results demonstrate that using features with lower entropies usually leads to better recommendation results.

TI Mining Check-In History for Personalized Location Naming
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Many innovative location-based services have been established to offer users greater convenience in their everyday lives. These services usually cannot map user's physical locations into semantic names automatically. The semantic names of locations provide important context for mobile recommendations and advertisements. In this article, we proposed a novel location naming approach which can automatically provide semantic names for users given their locations and time. In particular, when a user opens a GPS device and submits a query with her physical location and time, she will be returned the most appropriate semantic name. In our approach, we drew an analogy between location naming and local search, and designed a local search framework to propose a spatiotemporal and user preference (STUP) model for location naming. STUP combined three components, user preference (UP), spatial preference (SP), and temporal preference (TP), by leveraging learning-to-rank techniques. We evaluated STUP on 466,190 check-ins of 5,805 users from Shanghai and 135,052 check-ins of 1,361 users from Beijing. The results showed that SP was most effective among three components and that UP can provide personalized semantic names, and thus it was a necessity for location naming. Although TP was not as discriminative as the others, it can still be beneficial when integrated with SP and UP. Finally, according to the experimental results, STUP outperformed the proposed baselines and returned accurate semantic names for 23.6% and 26.6% of the testing queries from Beijing and Shanghai, respectively.

TI Recommending Friends Instantly in Location-based Mobile Social Networks
SO CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
AB Differently from the general online social network (OSN), location-based mobile social network (LMSN), which seamlessly integrates mobile computing and social computing technologies, has unique characteristics of temporal, spatial and social correlation. Recommending friends instantly based on current location of users in the real world has become increasingly popular in LMSN. However, the existing friend recommendation methods based on topological structures of a social network or non-topological information such as similar user profiles cannot well address the instant making friends in the real world. In this article, we analyze users' check-in behavior in a real LMSN site named Gowalla. According to this analysis, we present an approach of recommending friends instantly for LMSN users by considering the real-time physical location proximity, offline behavior similarity and friendship network information in the virtual community simultaneously. This approach effectively bridges the gap between the offline behavior of users in the real world and online friendship network information in the virtual community. Finally, we use the real user check-in dataset of Gowalla to verify the effectiveness of our approach.

TI Inferring social ties between users with human location history
SO JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING
AB The location-based social networks have been becoming flourishing in recent years. In this paper, we aim to estimate the similarity between users according to their physical location histories (represented by GPS trajectories). This similarity can be regarded as a potential social tie between users, thereby enabling friend and location recommendations. Different from previous work using social structures or directly matching users' physical locations, this approach model a user's GPS trajectories with a semantic location history (SLH), e.g., shopping malls -> restaurants -> cinemas. Then, we measure the similarity between different users' SLHs by using our maximal travel match (MTM) algorithm. The advantage of our approach lies in two aspects. First, SLH carries more semantic meanings of a user's interests beyond low-level geographic positions. Second, our approach can estimate the similarity between two users without overlaps in the geographic spaces, e.g., people living in different cities. When matching SLHs, we consider the sequential property, the granularity and the popularity of semantic locations. We evaluate our method based on a real-world GPS dataset collected by 109 users in a period of 1 year. The results show that SLH outperforms a physicallocation-based approach and MTM is more effective than several widely used sequence matching approaches given this application scenario.

AB Location-tagged social media have an increasingly important role in shaping behavior of individuals. With the help of location recommendations, users are able to learn about events, products or places of interest that are relevant to their preferences. User locations and movement patterns are available from geosocial networks such as Foursquare, mass transit logs or traffic monitoring systems. However, disclosing movement data raises serious privacy concerns, as the history of visited locations can reveal sensitive details about an individual's health status, alternative lifestyle, etc. In this paper, we investigate mechanisms to sanitize location data used in recommendations with the help of differential privacy. We also identify the main factors that must be taken into account to improve accuracy. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that a careful choice of differential privacy technique leads to satisfactory location recommendation results.

AB Understanding the dynamics of human daily mobility patterns is essential for the management and planning of urban facilities and services. Travel smart cards, which record users' public transporting histories, capture rich information of users' mobility pattern. This provides the opportunity to discover valuable knowledge from these transaction records. In recent years, research on measuring user similarity for behavior analysis has attracted a lot of attention in applications such as recommendation systems, crowd behavior analysis applications, and numerous data mining tasks. In this paper, our goal is to estimate the similarity between users' travel patterns according to their travel smart card data. The core of our proposal is a novel user similarity measurement, namely, Travel Spatial-Temporal Similarity (TST), which measures the spatial range and temporal similarity between users. Moreover, we also propose a hybrid index structure, which integrates inverted files and cluster-based partitioning, to allow for efficient retrieval of the top-K most similar users. Through experimental evaluation, our proposed approach is shown to deliver scalable performance.

AB Predicting movements of mobile users has become increasingly popular because of the ease of trajectory data collecting nowadays. However, as most of these prediction techniques need geographic pattern matching of users' trajectory data, it is possible that the techniques cannot work in a place where the user has never been before. In this paper, we propose an approach based on transportation mode and behavior semantic features to predict the next location of the users' movement. First, we identify the users' transportation mode to get sequential data of the users' motion mode. Then, we get the semantic meaning as behavior semantic features from the places where users have stopped and visited for a while. We determine the relationship between the transportation mode and behavior semantic features to predict the next location based on the Hidden Markov model. We use real world data for our experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Nowadays, mobile phones are often used as an attractive option for large-scale sensing of human behavior, providing a source of real and reliable data for urban computing. As it is known to all, a user's behavior often happened at some places where the user stayed over a certain time interval for a trip. For understanding a user's behavior effectively, we need to detect the places where the user stayed over a certain time interval and we call these places stay areas. In this paper, we propose a method for detecting the stay areas from a user's mobile phone data. The proposed method can tackle the complicated situations that the general method cannot deal with effectively. Through experimental evaluation, the proposed method is shown to deliver excellent performance.

TI Improving Location Prediction by Exploring Spatial-Temporal-Social Ties
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB As there is great differences of movement patterns and social correlation between weekdays and weekends, we propose a fallback social-temporal-hierarchic Markov model (FSTHM) to predict individual's future location. The division of weekdays and weekends is used to decompose the original state of traditional Markov model into two different states and distinguish the difference of the strength of social ties on weekdays and weekends. Except for the time division, the distribution of the visit time for each state is also considered to improve the predictive performance. In addition, in order to best suit the characteristics of Markov model, we introduce the modified cross-sample entropy to quantify the similarities between the individual and his friends. The experiments based on real location-based social network show the FSTHM model gives a 9% improvement over the Markov model and 2% improvement over the social Markov models which use cosine similarity or mutual information to measure the social correlation.

The global positioning system(GPS) is commonly used today and context awareness technologies are often adopted. To support efficient and effective telecommunications between a huge number of devices and the intelligent transport systems (ITS) services, a scalable networking platform is hence demanded. In this study, we present a novel approach to support an open architecture environment for telematics services based on international standards. The proposed core telematics platform (CTP) can optimize the data transmission under linearly increased time complexity by employing a high-scalable architecture design when a large number of devices connect to the application servers. The proposed context awareness application server (CAAS) approach can optimize context awareness features to provide personal tracking services to children and elders for safety purposes. The simulations and experiments in this study have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Today, people have the opportunity to opt-in to usage-based automotive insurances for reduced premiums by allowing companies to monitor their driving behavior. Several companies claim to measure only speed data to preserve privacy. With our elastic pathing algorithm, we show that drivers can be tracked by merely collecting their speed data and knowing their home location, which insurance companies do, with an accuracy that constitutes privacy intrusion. To demonstrate the algorithm's real-world applicability, we evaluated its performance with datasets from central New Jersey and Seattle, Washington, representing suburban and urban areas. Our algorithm predicted destinations with error within 250 meters for 14% traces and within 500 meters for 24% traces in the New Jersey dataset (254 traces). For the Seattle dataset (691 traces), we similarly predicted destinations with error within 250 and 500 meters for 13% and 26% of the traces respectively. Our work shows that these insurance schemes enable a substantial breach of privacy.

AB Mobile network user group of location-based service is of great value for O2O marketing. As a result check-in, as one of the most important parts of Location-Based Social Networks, has been attached with great attention. Through reflecting users' real offline life mode, it can explore the law behind the check-in behavior, which will help merchants better realize marketing precision and consumers get more high quality services at the same time. This paper collected check-in data in 6 months from one of China's largest social networks by using a crawler. It also designed a useful and effective Max Matching Algorithm, which creatively recognized check-in records so as to match these locations with POIs in POI Semantic Hierarchy Model, since users name the locations by themselves at will. Finally, a Check-in Behavior Information Model for each user could be constructed. On this basis, the paper analyzed users' empirical check-in data making using relevant statistics technology, such as descriptive statistics and cluster analysis, and studied the individual's main geographical activity areas and check-in POI types, Chinese users' regularity of check-in time distribution, all user's Significant Scores, and the dependent relationship between User Experience and POI Interest, in order to reveal the underlying user life mode and find out the frequency of check-in behavior. This paper hopes to find out active users and hot merchants to realize merchants ranking recommendation and loyal and potential consumers searching, and help local merchants improve the precision of marketing and provide better services for customs.

TI Mining Geographic-Temporal-Semantic Patterns in Trajectories for
   Location Prediction
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB In recent years, research on location predictions by mining trajectories of users has attracted a lot of attention. Existing studies on this topic mostly treat such predictions as just a type of location recommendation, that is, they predict the next location of a user using location recommenders. However, an user usually visits somewhere for reasons other than interestingness. In this article, we propose a novel mining-based location prediction approach called Geographic-Temporal-Semantic-based Location Prediction (GTS-LP), which takes into account a user's geographic-triggered intentions, temporal-triggered intentions, and semantic-triggered intentions, to estimate the probability of the user in visiting a location. The core idea underlying our proposal is the discovery of trajectory patterns of users, namely GTS patterns, to capture frequent movements triggered by the three kinds of intentions. To achieve this goal, we define a new trajectory pattern to capture the key properties of the behaviors that are motivated by the three kinds of intentions from trajectories of users. In our GTS-LP approach, we propose a series of novel matching strategies to calculate the similarity between the current movement of a user and discovered GTS patterns based on various moving intentions. On the basis of similitude, we make an online prediction as to the location the user intends to visit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on location prediction based on trajectory pattern mining that explores the geographic, temporal, and semantic properties simultaneously. By means of a comprehensive evaluation using various real trajectory datasets, we show that our proposed GTS-LP approach delivers excellent performance and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art location prediction methods.

In parallel, interest in movement has shifted from raw movement data analysis to more application-oriented ways of analyzing segments of movement suitable for the specific purposes of the application. This trend has promoted semantically rich trajectories, rather than raw movement, as the core object of interest in mobility studies. This survey provides the definitions of the basic concepts about mobility data, an analysis of the issues in mobility datamanagement, and a survey of the approaches and techniques for: (i) constructing trajectories from movement tracks, (ii) enriching trajectories with semantic information to enable the desired interpretations of movements, and (iii) using data mining to analyze semantic trajectories and extract knowledge about their characteristics, in particular the behavioral patterns of the moving objects. Last but not least, the article surveys the new privacy issues that arise due to the semantic aspects of trajectories.

TI Mining user similarity based on routine activities
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Mobile user similarity is significant for location-based social network services. With the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies, research on measuring mobile user similarity based on their trajectories has attracted a lot of attention. However, trajectories imply only short-term mobile regularities, and thus users' long-term activity similarity is difficult to be captured. In this paper, we address the problem of mining users' long-term activity similarity based on their trajectories. To solve this problem, we propose a two-stage approach. At the first stage, the notion of routine activity is proposed to capture users' long-term activity regularities. The routine activities of a user are extracted from his/her daily trajectories. At the second stage, user similarity is calculated hierarchically based on the extracted routine activities. Finally, we evaluated our approach based on both real and artificial datasets. The experimental results show that users with different profiles can be discriminated on the basis of our similarity metric, and thus demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TI A unified framework for recommending items, groups and friends in social
   media environment via mutual resource fusion
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Up to now, more and more online sites have started to allow their users to build the social relationships. Take the Last.fm for example (which is a popular music-sharing site), users can not only add each other as friends, but also join online interest groups where they shall meet people with common tastes. Therefore, in this environment, users might be interested in not only receiving item recommendations (such as music), but also getting friend suggestions so they might put them in the contact list, and group recommendations that they could consider joining. To support such demanding needs, in this paper, we propose a unified framework that provides three different types of recommendation in a single system: recommending items, recommending groups and recommending friends. For each type of recommendation, we in depth investigate the contribution of fusing other two auxiliary information resources (e.g., fusing friendship and membership for recommending items, and fusing user-item preferences and friendship for recommending groups) for boosting the algorithm performance. More notably, the algorithms were developed based on the matrix factorization framework in order to achieve the ideal efficiency as well as accuracy. We performed experiments with two large-scale real-world data sets that contain users' implicit interaction with items. The results revealed the effective fusion mechanism for each type of recommendation in such implicit data condition. Moreover, it demonstrates the respective merits of regularization model and factorization model: the factorization is more suitable for fusing bipartite data (such as membership and user-item preferences), while the regularization model better suits one mode data (like friendship). We further enhanced the friendship's regularization by integrating the similarity measure, which was experimentally proven with positive effect. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Semantic Trajectories: Mobility Data Computation and Annotation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
AB With the large-scale adoption of GPS equipped mobile sensing devices, positional data generated by moving objects (e.g., vehicles, people, animals) are being easily collected. Such data are typically modeled as streams of spatio-temporal (x,y,t) points, called trajectories. In recent years trajectory management research has progressed significantly towards efficient storage and indexing techniques, as well as suitable knowledge discovery. These works focused on the geometric aspect of the raw mobility data. We are now witnessing a growing demand in several application sectors (e.g., from shipment tracking to geo-social networks) on understanding the semantic behavior of moving objects. Semantic behavior refers to the use of semantic abstractions of the raw mobility data, including not only geometric patterns but also knowledge extracted jointly from the mobility data and the underlying geographic and application domains information. The core contribution of this article lies in a semantic model and a computation and annotation platform for developing a semantic approach that progressively transforms the raw mobility data into semantic trajectories enriched with segmentations and annotations. We also analyze a number of experiments we did with semantic trajectories in different domains.

TI A novel route restoring method upon geo-tagged photos
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Sharing geo-tagged photos has been a hot social activity in the daily life because these photos not only contain geo information but also indicate people's hobbies, intention and mobility patterns. However, the present raw geo-tagged photo routes cannot provide information as enough as complete GPS trajectories due to the defects hidden in them. This paper mainly aims at analyzing the large amounts of geo-tagged photos and proposing a novel travel route restoring method. In our approach we first propose an Interest Measure Ratio to rank the hot spots based on density-based spatial clustering arithmetic. Then we apply the Hidden Semi-Markov model and Mean Value method to demonstrate migration discipline in the hot spots and restore the significant region sequence into complete GPS trajectory. At the end of the paper, a novel experiment method is designed to demonstrate that the approach is feasible in restoring route, and there is a good performance.

AB Nowadays, researchers tend to make use of GPS trajectories collected by companies, organizations, or volunteers. GPS trajectories on crowdsourcing websites are less widely used in researches but actually have great potential for various applications. Thus, this paper makes a comprehensive study on GPS trajectories on VGI websites and social websites. The volume, growth rate, and categories of the data are analyzed, the accuracy and integrity are identified, and additional attributes of trajectories are also discussed. Statistical results indicate that the accuracy and integrity of the data is within acceptable limits. We also conclude that this data is suitable for travel-related studies, while may not for time-related researches. Further studies and sample surveys are needed to confirm if it's suitable for road information extraction. This data may be soon applicable to more researches because of its rapid development.

AB In this paper, we present an efficient method for recommending hotels for the users. Conventional hotel recommendation systems recommend hotels based on non-spatial attributes of hotels such as price and rating and do not utilize surrounding environments well. In contrast, we consider the coexistence of other facilities such as restaurants and entertainment facilities in the surrounding areas while selecting a hotel for recommendation.
   We first evaluate the surrounding environment of each hotel. Then, we consider user provided reviews about hotels where he stayed earlier. Based on the user's review, we calculate preferences of that user. Finally, we calculate similarity score between the hotels and the user's preferences and select the top-k hotels. We perform different experiments to show the effectiveness of our approach. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach is well applicable for recommending hotels for the users.

TI A SURVEY OF CONTEXT-AWARE MOBILE RECOMMENDATIONS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING
AB Mobile recommender systems target on recommending the right product or information to the right mobile users at anytime and anywhere. It is well known that the contextual information is often the key for the performances of mobile recommendations. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a focused survey of the recent development of context-aware mobile recommendations. After briefly reviewing the state-of-the-art of recommender systems, we first discuss the general notion of mobile context and how the contextual information is collected. Then, we introduce the existing approaches to exploit contextual information for modeling mobile recommendations. Furthermore, we summarize several existing recommendation tasks in the mobile scenarios, such as the recommendations in the tourism domain. Finally, we discuss some key issues that are still critical in the field of context-aware mobile recommendations, including the privacy problem, the energy efficiency issues, and the design of user interfaces.

TI Social itinerary recommendation from user-generated digital trails
SO PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING
AB Planning travel to unfamiliar regions is a difficult task for novice travelers. The burden can be eased if the resident of the area offers to help. In this paper, we propose a social itinerary recommendation by learning from multiple user-generated digital trails, such as GPS trajectories of residents and travel experts. In order to recommend satisfying itinerary to users, we present an itinerary model in terms of attributes extracted from user-generated GPS trajectories. On top of this itinerary model, we present a social itinerary recommendation framework to find and rank itinerary candidates. We evaluated the efficiency of our recommendation method against baseline algorithms with a large set of user-generated GPS trajectories collected from Beijing, China. First, systematically generated user queries are used to compare the recommendation performance in the algorithmic level. Second, a user study involving current residents of Beijing is conducted to compare user perception and satisfaction on the recommended itinerary. Third, we compare mobile-only approach with Mobile+Cloud architecture for practical mobile recommender deployment. Lastly, we discuss personalization and adaptation factors in social itinerary recommendation throughout the paper.

AB Friend recommendation is a very popular application in online social network(OSN) services to help users make new friends and expand their social circle. Much of the existing research is based on either topological structure of OSN or user profiles to recommend new friends, while research based on both topological structure and user profiles to recommend potentially common friends between two undirectly connected users is still lacking. Recommending potentially common friends is useful in practical applications such as finding potential partners between two business groups in commercial social network in order to expand their business range or to reach potential customers, finding common bus stops between two specified bus stops on traffic network etc. In this paper we propose a novel shortest path based common friends recommendation approach in OSN to find and recommend potential common friends between two users. Our approach consists of the improved Floyd_Warshall algorithm and the Extended Longest Common Subsequence(ELCS) algorithm on both the topological structures of OSN and the partial profiles of users. The experiment results show that our approach can help users find the potential common friends efficiently and effectively.

AB With rapid growth of the GPS enabled mobile device, location-based online social network services become more and more popular, and allow their users to share life experiences with location information. In this paper, we considered a method for recommending places to a user based on spatial databases of location-based online social network services. We used a user-based collaborative filtering method to make a set of recommended places. In the proposed method, we calculate similarity of users' check-in activities not only their positions but also their semantics such as "shopping", "eating", "drinking", and so forth. We empirically evaluated our method in a real database and found that it outperforms the naive singular value decomposition collaborative filtering recommendation by comparing the prediction accuracy.

AB The Twitter lists feature was launched in late 2009 and enables the creation of curated groups containing Twitter users. Each user can be a list author and decide the basis on which other users are added to a list. The most popular lists are those that associate with a topic. Twitter lists can be used as a powerful organisation tool, but its widespread adoption has been limited. The two main obstacles are the initial setup time and the effort of continual curation. In this paper we attempt to solve the first problem by applying unsupervised clustering algorithms to construct topic-based Twitter lists. We consider k-means and affinity propagation (AP) as clustering algorithms and evaluate these algorithms using two document representation techniques. The selected representation techniques are the popular term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) and the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model. We calculate the similarities for the clustering algorithms using five well-known similarity measures that have been used extensively in the text domain. The adjusted normalised information distance (ANID) was used to compare the clustering result yielded by k-means and affinity propagation. We found that the careful selection of a similarity measure, combined with the LDA topic model can provide a user with a sensible starting point for list creation.

In this paper, we present a context aware personalized recommendation system on web and mobile, which recommends relevant location-based data from user collection and consisting of GPS routes and photos. We recommend three types of items: services, photos and GPS routes that are points of interests in user's surrounding. We score all items from database based on four aspects of relevance: location, content, time and network. In order to personalize the results we built user profile based on user's activity in the system. We study performance of the system within MOPSI.

AB Location is a key element for ambient intelligence services. Due to GPS inaccuracies, inferring high level information (i.e., being at home, at work, in a restaurant) from geographic coordinates in still non trivial. In this paper we use information about activities being performed by the user to improve location recognition accuracy. Unlike traditional methods, relations between locations and activities are not extracted from training data but from an external commonsense knowledge base. Our approach maps location and activity labels to concepts organized within the Concept Net network. Then, it verifies their commonsense proximity by implementing a bio-inspired greedy algorithm. Experimental results show a sharp increase in localization accuracy.

Under the circumstances of trajectory-centric LBSN, we then explore two fundamental research points concerned with understanding users in terms of their locations. One is modeling the location history of an individual using the individual's trajectory data. The other is estimating the similarity between two different people according to their location histories. The inferred similarity represents the strength of connection between two users in a location-based social network, and can enable friend recommendations and community discovery. The general approaches for evaluating these applications are also presented.

A series of research topics are presented, with respect to mining the collective social knowledge from many users' GPS trajectories to facilitate travel. On the one hand, the generic travel recommendations provide a user with the most interesting locations, travel sequences, and travel experts in a region, as well as an effective itinerary conditioned by a user's starting location and an available time length. On the other hand, the personalized travel recommendations find the locations matching an individual's interests, which can be learned from the individual's historical data.
