AB Due to the advancement of mobile computing technology and the various
   sensors built in the smartphones, context-aware services are
   proliferating to everyday life. Location-based service (LBS), which
   provides the appropriate service to smartphone users according to their
   contexts, is becoming more popular, and the location is one of the most
   important contexts in LBS. Extracting and recognizing meaningful
   location and predicting next location are crucial for successful LBS.
   Many researchers have attempted to recognize and predict locations by
   various methods, but only few consider the development of real working
   system considering key tasks of LBS on the mobile platform. In this
   paper, we propose a location recognition and prediction system in
   smartphone environment, which consists of recognizing location and
   predicting destination for users. It recognizes user location by
   combining k-nearest neighbor and decision trees, and predicts user
   destination using hidden Markov models. To show the usefulness of the
   proposed system, we have conducted thorough experiments on real everyday
   life datasets collected from 10 persons for six months, and confirmed
   that the proposed system yielded above 90% of average location
   prediction accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, several high-speed applications have been emerged for personal
   communication service (PCS) networks. Therefore, locating mobile
   terminals (MTs) as they move from one place to another is the key to
   provide continuous services with unrestricted mobility. To maintain the
   continuity of service during handoffs, PCS involves the need to predict
   MTs' movements to cope with resource limitations and heterogeneity.
   Predicting MT's next location in PCS networks has become an inherently
   interesting and challenging problem. If we can correctly predict the
   next cell to which MTs are going, the performance of wireless
   applications, such as call admission control, QoS, and mobility
   management can be improved as well. Mobility prediction based on MTs'
   movement history has become an effective mean not only to decrease
   call-dropping probability, but also to shorten the handover latency.
   However, applying various basic prediction schemes to realistic
   environments has reported several limitations. Moreover, the randomness
   of MT's motion prevents the accurate prediction. In this paper, a Hybrid
   Mobility Prediction (HMP) strategy has been proposed. HMP provides
   flexible usage of the limited resources of PCS networks. It combines
   evidence from three different predictors, which are; probabilistic
   predictor (PP), group-based predictor (GP), and spatial predictor (SP).
   PP relies on Bayes theorem, GP uses ant colony optimization (ACO), while
   SP tries to detect the topological architecture of the current
   registration area to enhance the prediction process. HMP provides high
   accurate prediction of the next cell to which an MT is going, which
   avoids over reservation resulting in a waste of resources. Experimental
   results have shown that HMP outperforms recent prediction strategies as
   the amount of reserved resources is dynamically adjusted based on the
   predicted cell.

AB Due to the recent explosive growth of location-aware services based on
   mobile devices, predicting the next places of a user is of increasing
   importance to enable proactive information services. In this paper, we
   introduce a data-driven framework that aims to predict the user's next
   places using his/her past visiting patterns analyzed from mobile device
   logs. Specifically, the notion of the spatiotemporal-periodic (STP)
   pattern is proposed to capture the visits with spatiotemporal
   periodicity by focusing on a detail level of location for each
   individual. Subsequently, we present algorithms that extract the STP
   patterns from a user's past visiting behaviors and predict the next
   places based on the patterns. The experiment results obtained by using a
   real-world dataset show that the proposed methods are more effective in
   predicting the user's next places than the previous approaches
   considered in most cases.

AB Automatic Vehicle Monitoring (AVM) systems are exploited by public
   transport companies to manage and control their fleet of vehicles.
   However, these systems are usually based on the background knowledge of
   the transport network which can change during the time and in some cases
   can be missing or erroneous. GPS data and other information captured by
   the vehicles during their work can be exploited to update the network
   knowledge. This paper presents a novel approach, namely DeCoClu (Density
   Consensus Clustering), that aims at mining the topology of a public
   transport network by means of a consensus clustering density-based
   approach. In particular, the method exploits static information from
   time series of positioning signals (i.e., GPS data) to infer
   geographical locations of stops by means of a consensus clustering
   strategy based on a new distance function. Moreover, the logical pathway
   of a route (i.e., stops sequence) is defined by an Hamiltonian cycle.
   Experiments performed on real-data collections provided by a public
   transport company demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A personally semantic place is a space that is frequently visited by an
   individual user and carries important semantic meanings (e.g. home,
   work, etc.) to the user. Many location-aware applications could be
   greatly enhanced by the ability of automatic discovery of personally
   semantic places. The discovery of a user's personally semantic places
   involves obtaining the physical locations and semantic meanings of these
   places. In this paper, we propose approaches to address both of the
   problems. For the physical place extraction problem, a hierarchical
   clustering algorithm is proposed to firstly extract visit points from
   the GPS trajectories, and then clusters these visit points to form
   physical places. For the semantic place recognition problem, the
   temporal, spatial and sequential features in which the places have been
   visited are explored to categorize them into pre-defined types. An
   extensive set of experiments conducted based on a dataset of real-world
   GPS trajectories has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed
   approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Among the Organized crime, Human trafficking hold third place where as
   the first and second or drug and weapon trade across the globe. Human
   trafficking is a shame on Humanity. As per the report of Human Rights
   commission of India over 40,000 children are reported missing every year
   of which 11000 are untraced [1][2]. Another statics report saying 80% of
   human trafficking is done for sexual exploitation and rest is for bonded
   labors [2]. Sex traffickers often find pray as children because not only
   children are vulnerable than adults, but there is a high market demand
   for young victims. Traffickers target victims most often after school
   programs. It is a painful truth that India is considered as a hub for
   Human trafficking in Asia [2]. Even though it is difficult to eradicate
   the shame on human society, Here is a small initiative to reduce child
   trafficking by providing a child safety system.
   Apart from child security, as a Parent we have to consider and
   contribute in child education too. There is an ample amount of gap
   between Parent-Child-Education-Teacher. Parent have no clue how to
   contribute to their child education. How to bring focus to child in
   education and life. Vital factor of this is parent are busy with their
   job and no-time situation to take care of child, in the other hand as a
   teacher it is difficult to do individual care for every student they
   hold. In olden days the teacher and student ratio will be minimal but it
   is not the same case now. Even UGC is suggesting a norm of 1:25 ratio,
   but most of the educational institutions are not completely following it
   [4]. This leads to minimal interaction between students and teachers.
   The focus of this project is to deploy security system in hot spots like
   School, Home, Tuition centre and also in school buses or students own
   vehicle like bicycles etc.. The system comprise of RFID/NFC
   communication enabled smart Id card and a Child Safety device(CSD). The
   CSD is the combination of most commonly used technologies like GPS/GSM
   and RFID. The device communicates with the servers via GSM or internet
   enabled Wi-Fi or Ethernet cables. CSD helps to track the student on
   daily bases and report the parents and teachers about his/her activity.
   It is a combination of web portal and Android based mobile application
   provides the information about the student to parents and teachers with
   the help of CSD and smart id cards. Mobile app and Web portal helps
   teachers convey the performance of a student in his/her class, it helps
   parents to monitor and guide child to achieve goals.

AB Large scale disasters cause severe social disorder and trigger mass
   evacuation activities. Managing the evacuation shelters efficiently is
   crucial for disaster management. Kumamoto prefecture, Japan, was hit by
   an enormous (Magnitude 7.3) earthquake on 16th of April, 2016. As a
   result, more than 10,000 buildings were severely damaged and over
   100,000 people had to evacuate from their homes. After the earthquake,
   it took the decision makers several days to grasp the locations where
   people were evacuating, which delayed of distribution of supply and
   rescue. This situation was made even more complex since some people
   evacuated to places that were not designated as evacuation shelters.
   Conventional methods for grasping evacuation hotspots require on-foot
   field surveys that take time and are difficult to execute right after
   the hazard in the confusion.
   We propose a novel framework to efficiently estimate the evacuation
   hotspots after large disasters using location data collected from
   smartphones. To validate our framework and show the useful analysis
   using our output, we demonstrated the framework on the Kumamoto
   earthquake using GPS data of smartphones collected by Yahoo Japan. We
   verified that our estimation accuracy of evacuation hotspots were very
   high by checking the located facilities and also by comparing the
   population transition results with newspaper reports. Additionally, we
   demonstrated analysis using our framework outputs that would help
   decision makers, such as the population transition and function period
   of each hotspot. The efficiency of our framework is also validated by
   checking the processing time, showing that it could be utilized
   efficiently in disasters of any scale. Our framework provides useful
   output for decision makers that manage evacuation shelters after various
   kinds of large scale disasters.

AB VANETs have attracted researchers' attention lately because of the need
   to promote the driving experience by extending the drivers' view through
   wireless data exchange. Mobility prediction enables appealing proactive
   experiences for a wide range of VANET location-aware services and
   applications. In this work, we present more than a destination
   prediction technique. We introduce a mechanism for transforming the
   vehicles into smart entities based on a four dimensional model for
   destination prediction. The model comprises all possible aspects
   affecting the human mobility including time, social network and
   locations preference. Moreover, it takes the lead in leveraging the
   semantic properties of both the points of interest and the social
   relations to affect the visiting activities of the drivers. The
   experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly
   outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches achieving an average
   accuracy of 90%. In addition, the presented approach lays the groundwork
   for a realistic mobility model capable of simulating the mobility
   activities of an input social network with great precision,
   independently of any input trace.

AB Human mobility analysis and modeling is a very interdisciplinary field
   of research. Mobility models play an important role particularly in
   assessing the simulative performance of mobile and opportunistic
   networks. The mobility traces, which most of these models are based on,
   however, mostly suffer from several shortcomings. In this paper, we use
   the extensive Lausanne Data Collection Campaign (LDCC) mobility trace as
   basis for further map-oriented processing. Map-matching and sensible
   addition of optimal routes between points mitigate problems like GPS
   spatial noise, anonymization, and data gaps. Moreover, stay point
   extraction is performed as a preparation for the analysis of elemental
   statistical mobility characteristics. An exemplary impact evaluation of
   contact statistics shows that the resulting map-oriented trace basis is
   indeed suited for large-scale mobility analysis and simulation.

AB The growth of the world's population and the dramatic increase in
   average life expectancy raise awareness of the global burden of elderly
   diseases. Mild cognitive impairments affect elderly people, which suffer
   a deterioration of their capabilities, with special regard to memory.
   Such problems often lead to disorientation or wandering: erratic
   movements and changes in mobility and behavioural patterns. In this
   context, an early and automatic detection of wandering symptoms avoids
   risks and possible damages to these patients, improving their quality of
   life. However, wandering detection is not trivial, because several
   factors such as patterns, environment or the severity of the dementia
   need to be considered. The research community has proposed several
   techniques, algorithms and technologies in order to properly detect such
   abnormal behaviours. Moreover, the new health paradigm, Smart Health,
   opens the door to a new generation of systems and technologies in order
   to overcome the shortcomings of the classical methods in this field of
   research. This paper analyses the most relevant wandering detection
   methods present in the state-of-the-art.

AB Geospatial data, as a significant portion of big data, has recently
   gained the full attention of researchers. However, few researchers focus
   on the evolution of geospatial data and its scientific research
   methodologies. When entering into the big data era, fully understanding
   the changing research paradigm associated with geospatial data will
   definitely benefit future research on big data. In this paper, we look
   deep into these issues by examining the components and features of
   geospatial big data, reviewing relevant scientific research
   methodologies, and examining the evolving pattern of geospatial data in
   the scope of the four 'science paradigms'. This paper proposes that
   geospatial big data has significantly shifted the scientific research
   methodology from 'hypothesis to data' to 'data to questions' and it is
   important to explore the generality of growing geospatial data 'from
   bottom to top'. Particularly, four research areas that mostly reflect
   data-driven geospatial research are proposed: spatial correlation,
   spatial analytics, spatial visualization, and scientific knowledge
   discovery. It is also pointed out that privacy and quality issues of
   geospatial data may require more attention in the future. Also, some
   challenges and thoughts are raised for future discussion.

AB It is becoming increasingly important to accurately detect a user's
   presence at certain locations during certain times of the day,e.g., to
   study the user's patterns with respect to mobility, behavior, or social
   interactions and to enable the delivery of targeted services. However,
   instead of geographic locations, it is often more important to determine
   a locale that is important to the user,e.g., the place of work, home,
   homes of family and friends, social gathering places, etc. These
   significant personal places can be determined through analysis,e.g., via
   segmentation of location traces into a discrete sequence of places.
   However, segmentation of traces with many gaps (e.g., due to loss of
   network or GPS signal) results in a large number of small segments,
   where many of these segments actually belong together. This work
   proposes a new segmentation approach that opportunistically fills gaps
   in location traces with the help of data from other (co-located) users.
   Using data from 195 users, collected over a 2-year period, we show that
   this approach yields fewer and larger segments, where each segment
   accurately represents the presence of a user at a significant personal
   place.

AB Location, or place, is a key piece of information when providing
   context-aware services to users in smart environments. Many researchers
   in the mobile robotics community or context-aware service system sector
   have suggested various solutions using vision data processing or
   additional geographical information such as from Google Maps. However,
   recognizing a place by processing vision and image data brings a huge
   burden on Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Geographical information
   such as a building's exact structural configuration may not be available
   for IoT devices. As the number of IoTs grows rapidly, limitations of
   existing approaches can be solved with the IoT environment, since IoT
   devices in close proximity to one another can detect each other easily.
   In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes Key-Device
   values and similarity measure between devices to recognize a place. Our
   proposed approach measures similarity between IoT space input and
   representative feature set of each known place a priori, and determines
   the most probable place of the IoT space. We evaluate with Euclidean
   distance, cosine similarity, and weighted cosine similarity.
   Experimental results show that the Key- Device concept remarkably
   improves precision and recall of place recognition.

AB Trajectory pattern mining has been performed over many datasets,
   including animal movement, GPS trajectories, and human travel history.
   This paper aims to explore and mine individual frequently visited
   regions and trajectory patterns using online footprints captured through
   a social media site (i.e., Twitter). Regions of frequent visits
   representing daily activity areas at which an individual appears are
   derived using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. A trajectory pattern
   mining algorithm is then applied to discover ordered sequences of these
   spatial regions that the individual visits frequently. To illustrate and
   test the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we analyze the activity
   patterns of a selected Twitter user using the geo-tagged tweets posted
   by the user for an extended period. The preliminary assessment indicates
   that our approach can be applied to mine individual frequent trajectory
   patterns from online footprints that are of relatively low and irregular
   spatial and temporal resolutions.

   which context-aware notifications will be triggered and responded in
   time. In this paper, we discuss methods to improve the design of
   context-aware notifications. Using the data from our prior experiment,
   we identify main factors that influence citizens' responses to
   notifications and evaluate the predictability of quick responses using a
   simplified method. We then propose a model for designing civic
   crowdsourcing tasks based on historical information. We believe that
   creating well-designed notifications can decrease receivers' workloads
   and simultaneously expands the positive impacts of civic crowdsourcing
   on the quality of life in the city.

AB Existing fingerprint-based places of interest (POIs) finding approaches
   mainly rely on WiFi signal fingerprints of fixed access points. Due to
   the prevalence of smartphones and 3G networks, the increasing number of
   smartphones acting as mobile access points in public places have
   hindered the ability to effectively learn and identify POIs. The
   effective removal of these casually appearing WiFi beacons generated by
   mobile access points has recently become the centre of attention for a
   lot of research. In this paper, we propose the self-adjustment POI
   discovery system (SAPID) to deal with the aforementioned problem. With
   the proposed weighted merging of the fingerprints of entrance and
   matched POI, the SAPID is more robust than BeaconPrint, PlaceSence, and
   SensLoc in detecting POIs located in public places. The experiment
   results show that compared to those state-of-art place discovery
   algorithms, the SAPID has better precision, recall, and F1 score in POI
   discovery.

AB Human mobility prediction in ubiquitous computing is the ability of a
   system to forecast the anticipated movement of an individual or a group
   of persons. This interdisciplinary problem has gained traction in fields
   of academic and industrial research mainly because it is fundamental to
   achieving system efficiency and marketing efficacy in many applications.
   This study seeks to develop a novel heuristic technique that predicts
   the actual geo-spatial locations associated with the most probable
   semantic tags of locations (e.g. restaurant) that individuals are likely
   to visit. The intuition of this work lies in the fact that, for any
   given probable future semantic tag there exists multiple geo-spatial
   locations associated with it, hence the need to disambiguate the actual
   destination location. We develop an algorithm STS-predict, that exploits
   the spatio-temporal relationships between the current location of a
   target individual and candidate geo-spatial locations associated with
   future semantic tags to predict the actual destination location. We
   evaluate our approach on a real world GPS trajectory dataset.

AB Purpose - The prediction of a context, especially of a user's location,
   is a fundamental task in the field of pervasive computing. Such
   predictions open up a new and rich field of proactive adaptation for
   context-aware applications. This study/paper aims to propose a
   methodology that predicts a user's location on the basis of a user's
   mobility history.
   Design/methodology/approach - Contextual information is used to find the
   points of interest that a user visits frequently and to determine the
   sequence of these visits with the aid of spatial clustering, temporal
   segmentation and speed filtering.
   Findings - The proposed method was tested with a real data set using
   several supervised classification algorithms, which yielded very
   interesting results.
   Originality/value - The method uses contextual information (current
   position, day of the week, time and speed) that can be acquired easily
   and accurately with the help of common sensors such as GPS.

AB Leakage of user location and traffic patterns is a serious security
   threat with significant implications on privacy as reported by recent
   surveys and identified by the US Congress Location Privacy Protection
   Act of 2014. While mobile phones can restrict the explicit access to
   location information to applications authorized by the user, they are
   ill-equipped to protect against side-channel attacks. In this paper, we
   show that a zero-permissions Android app can infer vehicular users'
   location and traveled routes, with high accuracy and without the users'
   knowledge, using gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer information.
   We modeled this problem as a maximum likelihood route identification on
   a graph. The graph is generated from the OpenStreetMap publicly
   available database of roads. Our route identification algorithms output
   both a ranked list of potential routes as well a ranked list of
   route-clusters. Through extensive simulations over 11 cities, we show
   that for most cities with probability higher than 50% it is possible to
   output a short list of 10 routes containing the traveled route. In real
   driving experiments (over 980 Km) in the cities of Boston (resp.
   Waltham), Massachusetts, we report a probability of 30% (resp. 60%) of
   inferring a list of 10 routes containing the true route.

AB In location prediction systems, the purpose is to infer mobility pattern
   of individuals so that applications can know in advance where a user
   will go next. Although researchers have proposed many schemes to achieve
   better accuracy in location prediction systems, this area is still open
   to further research. In this study, we investigate the potential to
   improve performance (accuracy and training time) of location prediction
   models by leveraging large scale data. Given that users closer in space
   would exhibit similar mobility behaviors, our idea is to create what we
   are calling a community model for a group of users in a given geographic
   area and then use parameters from this model to enhance performance for
   individual users in the same community. We choose to experiment with
   logistic regression classifier and use a real life dataset to
   investigate this idea. The results from our experiments show that our
   idea to use community-wide learned model parameters in individuals works
   very well and reduces training time for individual models by nearly 100
   percent. However, we don't find similar improvements in accuracy.

   The goal is to enhance the accuracy of the data collected through the
   better identification of single-mode trips and trip segments while
   minimizing the participant's involvement and preserving battery life.
   The proposed method works independently of data from external sources
   and can be implemented in smartphone applications to enhance the
   accuracy of the data that are collected and minimize the amount of data
   that need to be transferred. The method consists of a combination of
   real-time processing and postprocessing of the data and incorporates a
   series of rules to clean, split, and merge trips and trip segments, if
   required. The performance of the model was evaluated in a real-world
   experiment, in which it achieved an overall accuracy of 97% for the
   detection of trips from records of daily tracks. The analysis of the
   results shows that the implementation of the trip detection model
   increased the proportion of nonmotorized trips detected by 6%. In
   addition, the implementation of the model increased the accuracy of the
   data on the duration and the length of the recorded trips.

   basic information of taxi passenger distribution in Seoul city. The data
   is analyzed using multidimensional analyzed where the parameter
   location, time and frequency are mainly used. The general taxi passenger
   distribution result shows that Gangnam district got the highest number
   of passenger; especially from Teheran street. From the specific area,
   Dongdaemun market also give the high contribution of taxi passenger
   where around 25 % are used taxi when many people went out to shopping.
   The riding time analysis result shows that 30 % of passengers are rode
   the taxi in short time and use inside their district only; not across to
   the others district. Using this basic information, the taxi company can
   consider and manage their taxi dispatching location to increase the

AB Place learning is a process of analyzing various sensor data (e.g.,
   continuously collected Wi-Fi scans) to discover the places, which are
   related to a user's routines or activities in his daily life. While the
   geometry-based approaches can correctly distinguish places in different
   buildings, most of the fingerprint-based approaches can correctly
   distinguish places in different rooms. However, if two neighbouring
   places are very near to each other, they are likely to be learned as a
   single place. Previous studies do not specifically indicate the minimum
   distance to distinguish neighbouring places. In this paper, we deal with
   the question of "how near is near" for two neighbouring places, and
   experimentally investigate the minimum distance required to distinguish
   two neighbouring places. Results of the case studies show that places in
   adjacent rooms or with a distance of at least 4-5 meters can be
   correctly distinguished, while locations with a distance of fewer than 4
   meters are likely to be learned as one place in the indoor environments.

AB Rooted in the philosophy of point-and segment-based approaches for
   transportation mode segmentation of trajectories, the measures that
   researchers have adopted to evaluate the quality of the results (1) are
   incomparable across approaches, hence slowing the progress in the field
   and (2) do not provide insight about the quality of the continuous
   transportation mode segmentation. To address these problems, this paper
   proposes new error measures that can be applied to measure how well a
   continuous transportation mode segmentation model performs. The error
   measures introduced are based on aligning multiple inferred continuous
   intervals to ground truth intervals, and measure the cardinality of the
   alignment and the spatial and temporal discrepancy between the
   corresponding aligned segments. The utility of this new way of computing
   errors is shown by evaluating the segmentation of three generic
   transportation mode segmentation approaches (implicit,
   explicit-holistic, and explicit-consensus-based transport mode
   segmentation), which can be implemented in a thick client architecture.
   Empirical evaluations on a large real-word data set reveal the
   superiority of explicit-consensus-based transport mode segmentation,
   which can be attributed to the explicit modeling of segments and
   transitions, which allows for a meaningful decomposition of the complex
   learning task.

   emphasize the cooperation between the disciplines of psychology and
   computer science in handling large data sets derived from heavily used
   devices, such as smartphones or online social network sites, in order to
   shed light on a large number of psychological traits, including
   personality and mood. New challenges await psychologists in light of the
   resulting "Big Data" sets, because classic psychological methods will
   only in part be able to analyze this data derived from ubiquitous mobile
   devices, as well as other everyday technologies. As a consequence,
   psychologists must enrich their scientific methods through the inclusion
   of methods from informatics. The paper provides a brief review of one
   area of this research field, dealing mainly with social networks and
   smartphones. Moreover, we highlight how data derived from
   Psychoinformatics can be combined in a meaningful way with data from
   human neuroscience. We close the paper with some observations of areas
   for future research and problems that require consideration within this
   new discipline.

AB Capacity planning is a key challenge for long-distance coach vendors due
   to the competitive market pressure. Travel-intensive events have the
   potential to increase the capacities for existing routes or to offer new
   connections. Actually, planning activities of vendors are mainly based
   on past-data. To improve the quality of predictions about future
   capacities, information from different data sources e.g. social media,
   geo-based information or websites has to be considered. Technologies to
   collect structured and unstructured information from different data
   sources are available. This paper presents an approach to use these
   technologies for capacity predictions and pricing of coach vendors in
   terms of travel-intensive events. To verify the approach, a case study,
   focused on the UEFA EURO 2016, is described. The case study is necessary
   to demonstrate the value of the research and to give a deeper
   understanding about data sources and the discussion culture of travelers
   in social networks.

AB With the wide use of mobile devices, predicting the destination of
   moving vehicles has become an increasingly important problem for
   location based recommendation systems and destination-based advertising.
   Most existing approaches are based on various Markov chain models, in
   which the historical trajectories are used to train the model and the
   top-k most probable destinations are returned. We identify certain
   limitations of the previous approaches. Instead, we propose a new
   data-driven framework, called DESTPRE, which is not based on a
   probabilistic model, but directly operates on the trajectories and makes
   the prediction. We make use of only historic trajectories, without
   individual identity information. Our design of DESTPRE, although simple,
   is a result of several useful observations from the real trajectory
   data. DESTPRE involves an index based on Bucket PR Quadtree and Minwise
   hashing, for efficiently retrieving similar trajectories, and a
   clustering on destinations for predictions. By incorporating some
   additional ideas, we show that the prediction accuracy can be further
   improved. We have conducted extensive experiments on real Beijing Taxi
   dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
   DESTPRE.

AB This article describes iDiary, a system that takes as input GPS data
   streams generated by users' phones and turns them into textual
   descriptions of the trajectories. The system features a user interface
   similar to Google Search that allows users to type text queries on their
   activities (e.g., "Where did I buy books?") and receive textual answers
   based on their GPS signals. iDiary uses novel algorithms for semantic
   compression and trajectory clustering of massive GPS signals in parallel
   to compute the critical locations of a user. We encode these problems as
   follows. The k-segment mean is a k-piecewise linear function that
   minimizes the regression distance to the signal. The (k, m)-segment mean
   has an additional constraint that the projection of the k segments on
   R-d consists of only m <= k segments. A coreset for this problem is a
   smart compression of the input signal that allows computation of a (1 +
   epsilon)-approximation to its k-segment or (k, m)-segment mean in O(nlog
   n) time for arbitrary constants e, k, and m. We use coresets to obtain a
   parallel algorithm that scans the signal in one pass, using space and
   update time per point that is polynomial in log n. Using an external
   database, we then map these locations to textual descriptions and
   activities so that we can apply text mining techniques on the resulting
   data (e.g., LSA or transportation mode recognition). We provide
   experimental results for both the system and algorithms and compare them
   to existing commercial and academic state of the art. This is the first
   GPS system that enables text-searchable activities from GPS data.

AB One of the greatest concerns related to the popularity of GPS-enabled
   devices and applications is the increasing availability of the personal
   location information generated by them and shared with application and
   service providers. Moreover, people tend to have regular routines and be
   characterized by a set of "significant places", thus making it possible
   to identify a user from his/her mobility data.
   In this paper we present a series of techniques for identifying
   individuals from their GPS movements. More specifically, we study the
   uniqueness of GPS information for three popular datasets, and we provide
   a detailed analysis of the discriminatory power of speed, direction and
   distance of travel. Most importantly, we present a simple yet effective
   technique for the identification of users from location information that
   are not included in the original dataset used for training, thus raising
   important privacy concerns for the management of location datasets.

AB The collection of actual traffic delays and road traffic speed data is
   essential in modelling urban transport resource efficiency, congestion
   and carbon and pollutant emissions, which is in turn part of core
   empirical basis for evidence-based policy making for improving urban
   sustainability. This data collection has also been one of the most
   expensive and time-consuming tasks, which restricts how well and how
   often the models can be built and validated, often to the extent that
   urban transport models have to rely on severely outdated data with
   sparse coverage. New smart data such as GPS vehicle traces has raised
   the prospect of remedying the data shortage, but for operational and
   data protection reasons often only low-sampling frequency traces are
   available. This paper proposes a novel method for estimating actual,
   congested link-speeds from low-sampling frequency taxi GPS traces that
   are publicly available. The method is based on a path inference process
   and is applied over a detailed road network in a large city region. It
   shows that low frequency GPS trajectories can significantly improve the
   spatial and temporal resolutions of traffic speed data for transport
   modelling and policy analysis. This opens up the prospect of improving
   road operation performance, managing travel demand and optimizing urban
   circulation.

AB Human mobility patterns can provide valuable information in
   understanding the impact of human behavioral regularities in urban
   systems, usually with a specific focus on traffic prediction, public
   health or urban planning. While existing studies on human movement have
   placed huge emphasis on spatial location to predict where people go
   next, the time dimension component is usually being treated with
   oversimplification or even being neglected. Time dimension is crucial to
   understanding and detecting human activity changes, which play a
   negative role in prediction and thus may affect the predictive accuracy.
   This study aims to predict human movement from a spatio-temporal
   perspective by taking into account the impact of activity changes. We
   analyze and define changes of human activity and propose an algorithm to
   detect such changes, based on which a Markov chain model is used to
   predict human movement. The Microsoft GeoLife dataset is used to test
   our methodology, and the data of two selected users is used to evaluate
   the performance of the prediction. We compare the predictive accuracy
   (R-2) derived from the data with and without implementing the activity
   change detection. The results show that the R-2 is improved from 0.295
   to 0.762 for the user with obvious activity changes and from 0.965 to
   0.971 for the user without obvious activity changes. The method proposed
   by this study improves the accuracy in analyzing and predicting human
   movement and lays the foundation for related urban studies.

AB The identification of activity locations in continuous GPS trajectories
   is an essential preliminary step in obtaining person trip data and for
   activity-based transportation demand forecasting. In this research, a
   two-step methodology for identifying activity stop locations is
   proposed. In the first step, an improved density-based spatial
   clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm identifies stop
   points and moving points; then in the second step, the support vector
   machines (SVMs) method distinguishes activity stops from non-activity
   stops among the identified stop points. A time sequence constraint and a
   direction change constraint are applied as improvements to DBSCAN
   (yielding an improved algorithm known as C-DBSCAN). Then three major
   features are extracted for use in the SVMs method: stop duration, mean
   distance to the centroid of a cluster of points at a stop location, and
   the shorter of distances from current location to home and to the
   workplace. The proposed methodology was tested using GPS data collected
   from mobile phones in the Nagoya area of Japan. The C-DBSCAN algorithm
   achieves an accuracy of 90 % in identifying stop points in the first
   step, while the SVMs method is 96 % accurate in distinguishing the
   locations of activity stops from non-activity stops in the second step.
   Compared to other variants of DBSCAN used to identify activity locations
   from GPS trajectories, this two-step method is generally superior.

AB Extracting meaningful information from the growing quantity of spatial
   data is a challenge. The issues are particularly evident with
   spatio-temporal data describing movement. Such data typically
   corresponds to movement of humans, animals and machines in the physical
   environment. This article considers a special form of movement data
   generated through human-computer interactions with online web maps. As a
   user interacts with a web map using a mouse as a pointing tool,
   invisible trajectories are generated. By examining the spatial features
   on the map where the mouse cursor visits, a user's interests and
   experience can be detected. To analyse this valuable information, we
   have developed a geovisual analysis tool which provides a rich insight
   into such user behaviour. The focus of this paper is on a clustering
   technique which we apply to mouse trajectories to group trajectories
   with similar behavioural properties. Our experiments reveal that it is
   possible to identify experienced and novice users of web mapping
   environments using an incremental clustering approach. The results can
   be used to provide personalised map interfaces to users and provide
   appropriate interventions for completing spatial tasks.

AB In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), effective prediction of time-varying
   interferences can enable adaptive transmission designs and therefore
   improve the communication performance. This paper investigates
   interference prediction in MANETs with a finite number of nodes by
   proposing and using a general-order linear model for node mobility. The
   proposed mobility model can well approximate node dynamics of practical
   MANETs. In contrast to previous studies on interference statistics, we
   are able through this model to give a best estimate of the time-varying
   interference at any time rather than long-term average effects.
   Specifically, we propose a compound Gaussian point process functional as
   a general framework to obtain analytical results on the mean value and
   moment-generating function of the interference prediction. With a series
   form of this functional, we give the necessary and sufficient condition
   for when the prediction is essentially equivalent to that from a
   binomial point process (BPP) network in the limit as time goes to
   infinity. These conditions permit one to rigorously determine when the
   commonly used BPP approximations are valid. Finally, our simulation
   results corroborate the effectiveness and accuracy of the analytical
   results on interference prediction and also show the advantages of our
   method in dealing with complex mobilities.

   them to receive highly relevant mobile ads that are aware of their place
   visit patterns in shopping malls. To achieve the goal, VisitSense
   employs accurate visit detection and prediction methods. For accurate
   visit detection, we develop a change-based detection method to take into
   consideration the stability change of ambient radio and the mobility
   change of users. It performs well in large shopping malls where ambient
   radio is quite noisy and causes existing algorithms to easily fail. In
   addition, we proposed a causality-based visit prediction model to
   capture the causality in the sequential visit patterns for effective
   prediction. We have developed a VisitSense prototype system, and a
   visit-pattern-aware mobile advertising application that is based on it.
   Furthermore, we deploy the system in the COEX Mall, one of the largest
   shopping malls in Korea, and conduct diverse experiments to show the

AB Human mobility prediction is an important problem that has a large
   number of applications, especially in context-aware services. This paper
   presents a study on location prediction using smartphone data, in which
   we address modeling and application aspects. Building personalized
   location prediction models from smartphone data remains a technical
   challenge due to data sparsity, which comes from the complexity of human
   behavior and the typically limited amount of data available for
   individual users. To address this problem, we propose an approach based
   on kernel density estimation, a popular smoothing technique for sparse
   data. Our approach contributes to existing work in two ways. First, our
   proposed model can estimate the probability that a user will be at a
   given location at a specific time in the future, by using both spatial
   and temporal information via multiple kernel functions. Second, we also
   show how our probabilistic framework extends to a more practical task of
   location prediction for a time window in the future. Our approach is
   validated on an everyday life location dataset consisting of 133
   smartphone users. Our method reaches an accuracy of 84% for the next
   hour, and an accuracy of 77% for the next three hours. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB Massive and passive data such as cell phone traces provide samples of
   the whereabouts and movements of individuals. These are a potential
   source of information for models of daily activities in a city. The main
   challenge is that phone traces have low spatial precision and are
   sparsely sampled in time, which requires a precise set of techniques for
   mining hidden valuable information they contain. Here we propose a
   method to reveal activity patterns that emerge from cell phone data by
   analyzing relational signatures of activity time, duration, and land
   use. First, we present a method of how to detect stays and extract a
   robust set of geolocated time stamps that represent trip chains. Second,
   we show how to cluster activities by combining the detected trip chains
   with land use data. This is accomplished by modeling the dependencies
   between activity type, trip scheduling, and land use types via a
   Relational Markov Network. We apply the method to two different kinds of
   mobile phone datasets from the metropolitan areas of Vienna, Austria and
   Boston, USA. The former data includes information from mobility
   management signals, while the latter are usual Call Detail Records. The
   resulting trip sequence patterns and activity scheduling from both
   datasets agree well with their respective city surveys, and we show that
   the inferred activity clusters are stable across different days and both
   cities. This method to infer activity patterns from cell phone data
   allows us to use these as a novel and cheaper data source for
   activity-based modeling and travel behavior studies.

   patterns based on a large mobile phone location dataset from Shenzhen,
   China. First, we estimate each individual's "home" anchor point, and a
   modified standard distance () is proposed to measure the spread of each
   individual's activity space centered at this "home" anchor point. We
   then derive aggregate mobility patterns at mobile phone tower level to
   describe the distance distribution of for people who share the same
   "home" anchor point. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is performed
   and the spatial distributions of the derived clusters are analyzed to
   highlight areas with similar aggregate human mobility patterns. The
   results suggest that 43 % of the population sample travelled within a
   short distance () during the 13-day study period while 23.9 % of them
   were associated with a large activity space (). The geographical
   differences of people's mobility patterns in Shenzhen are evident. Areas
   with a large proportion of people who have a small activity space mainly
   locate in the northern part of Shenzhen such as Baoan and Longgang
   districts. In the southern part where the economy is highly developed,
   the percentage of people with a larger activity space is higher in
   general. The findings could offer useful implications on policy and
   decision making. The proposed approach can also be used in other studies
   involving similar spatiotemporal datasets for travel behavior and policy
   analysis.

AB Recently, points of interest (POIs) recommendation has evolved into a
   hot research topic with real-world applications. In this paper, we
   propose a novel semantics-enhanced density-based clustering algorithm
   SEM-DTBJ-Cluster, to extract semantic POIs from GPS trajectories. We
   then take into account three different factors (popularity, temporal and
   geographical features) that can influence the recommendation score of a
   POI. We characterize the impacts caused by popularity, temporal and
   geographical information, by using different scoring functions based on
   three developed recommendation models. Finally, we combine the three
   scoring functions together and obtain a unified framework PTG-Recommend
   for recommending candidate POIs for a mobile user. To the best of our
   knowledge, this work is the first that considers popularity, temporal
   and geographical information together. Experimental results on two
   real-world data sets strongly demonstrate that our framework is robust
   and effective, and outperforms the baseline recommendation methods in
   terms of precision and recall.

AB Stay points are important for recognizing significant places from a
   mobile user's GPS trajectory. Such places are often located indoors and
   in urban canyons, where GPS is unreliable. Consequently, mapping a
   user's stay point to a Place of Interest (POI) using only GPS data is
   particularly challenging. Our novel algorithm employs both
   spatio-temporaldensity estimation and line count inference to predict
   and rank a user's POI(s) at building level accuracy from noisy
   time-annotated GPS data points. An experimental study demonstrates the
   superiority of our algorithm against several baseline approaches with a
   recall of 96.5% for the top 5 retrieved locations. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB This article presents a new method for collecting travel behavior data,
   based on a combination of GPS tracking and SMS technology, coined the
   SMS-GPS-Trip method. The state-of-the-art method for collecting data for
   activity based traffic models is a combination of travel diaries and GPS
   tracking data, an approach which is not well suited for capturing data
   on experiences surrounding trips. Currently increasing research is being
   done on how to incorporate such data in traffic models, and there is
   therefore a need for a method, which is suited to collect such data. The
   new method presented in this article builds on ideas from experience
   sampling methods (ESM) and it is well suited specifically for collecting
   such experience data. Given the use of SMS technology, this method makes
   it possible to reach a wide range of respondents. The usefulness of the
   new method is proven on a theoretical level and illustrated in practice
   through a case study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Today's mobile phones are far from the mere communication devices they
   were 10 years ago. Equipped with sophisticated sensors and advanced
   computing hardware, phones can be used to infer users' location,
   activity, social setting, and more. As devices become increasingly
   intelligent, their capabilities evolve beyond inferring context to
   predicting it, and then reasoning and acting upon the predicted context.
   This article provides an overview of the current state of the art in
   mobile sensing and context prediction paving the way for full-fledged
   anticipatory mobile computing. We present a survey of phenomena that
   mobile phones can infer and predict, and offer a description of machine
   learning techniques used for such predictions. We then discuss proactive
   decision making and decision delivery via the user-device feedback loop.
   Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of anticipatory
   mobile computing.

AB Destination prediction is an essential task for many emerging
   location-based applications such as recommending sightseeing places and
   targeted advertising according to destinations. A common approach to
   destination prediction is to derive the probability of a location being
   the destination based on historical trajectories. However, almost all
   the existing techniques use various kinds of extra information such as
   road network, proprietary travel planner, statistics requested from
   government, and personal driving habits. Such extra information, in most
   circumstances, is unavailable or very costly to obtain. Thereby we
   approach the task of destination prediction by using only historical
   trajectory dataset. However, this approach encounters the "data sparsity
   problem", i.e., the available historical trajectories are far from
   enough to cover all possible query trajectories, which considerably
   limits the number of query trajectories that can obtain predicted
   destinations. We propose a novel method named Sub-Trajectory Synthesis
   (SubSyn) to address the data sparsity problem. SubSyn first decomposes
   historical trajectories into sub-trajectories comprising two adjacent
   locations, and then connects the sub-trajectories into "synthesised"
   trajectories. This process effectively expands the historical trajectory
   dataset to contain much more trajectories. Experiments based on real
   datasets show that SubSyn can predict destinations for up to ten times
   more query trajectories than a baseline prediction algorithm.
   Furthermore, the running time of the SubSyn-training algorithm is almost
   negligible for a large set of 1.9 million trajectories, and the
   SubSyn-prediction algorithm runs over two orders of magnitude faster
   than the baseline prediction algorithm constantly.

AB This position paper presents our vision for the semantic management of
   moving objects. We argue that exploiting semantic techniques in mobility
   data management can bring valuable benefits to many domains
   characterized by the mobility of users and moving. objects in general,
   such as traffic management, urban dynamics analysis, ambient assisted
   living, emergency management, m-health, etc. We present the
   state-of-the-art in the domain of management of semantic locations and
   trajectories, and outline research challenges that need to be
   investigated to enable a full-fledged and intelligent semantic
   management of moving objects and location-based services that support
   smarter mobility. We propose a distributed framework for the semantic
   enrichment and management of mobility data and analyze the potential
   deployment and exploitation of such a framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
