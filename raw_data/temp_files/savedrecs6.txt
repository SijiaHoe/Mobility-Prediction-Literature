AB Mobility tracking plays an important role in identifying human
   activities and providing location-based services (LBSs). Up to now, with
   the help of special infrastructures or hardware devices, many existing
   tracking systems involve some cumbersome work of fingerprint or landmark
   calibration. In this letter, we present an adaptive mobility map
   construction scheme for large-scale Wi-Fi mobility tracking in indoor
   areas which does not require any off-line fingerprinting effort or
   deployment of landmarks. Our scheme works by collecting a large data-set
   of Wi-Fi received signal strength using a large number of cell phones
   carried by users during their normal daily activities.

AB In this paper, a new framework to discover places-of-interest from
   multimodal mobile phone data is presented. Mobile phones have been used
   as sensors to obtain location information from users' real lives. A
   place-of-interest is defined as a location where the user usually goes
   and stays for a while. Two levels of clustering are used to obtain
   places of interest. First, user location points are grouped using a
   time-based clustering technique which discovers stay points while
   dealing with missing location data. The second level performs clustering
   on the stay points to obtain stay regions. Agrid-based clustering
   algorithm has been used for this purpose. To obtain more user location
   points, a client-server system has been installed on the mobile phones,
   which is able to obtain location information by integrating GPS, Wifi,
   GSM and accelerometer sensors, among others. An extensive set of
   experiments has been performed to show the benefits of using the
   proposed framework, using data from the real life of a significant
   number of users over almost a year of natural phone usage.

AB Travel modes are one of the crucial pieces of information to
   characterize one's travel behavior. In recent years several approaches
   of mode detection from GPS data have been proposed. The approach
   presented in this paper uses machine learning to evaluate a set of
   GPS-based features for their ability to recognize the common modes walk,
   bicycle, car, bus, and train. The proposed features describe motion
   characteristics from GPS-trajectories by relative frequencies. Compared
   to previous work the proposed feature set leads to higher average
   recognition rates around 92% without relying on additional GIS or
   real-time information. The evaluation compares detection rates from
   multilayer perceptrons, logistic model trees, and C4.5 decision trees
   and is complemented by an evolutionary feature selection for selecting
   the most beneficial feature subsets leading to the best quality gain. In
   contrast to other research, this study uses a comparatively large set of
   400 GPS trajectories which have been recorded in rural and urban
   European areas. Results contribute to a higher reliability as well as a
   broader applicability of GPS-only travel mode detection.

AB Data transfers scheduling is an important part of almost all distributed
   virtual walkthrough (DVW) applications. Its main purpose is to preserve
   data transfer efficiency and render quality during scene exploration.
   The most limiting factors here are network restrictions such as low
   bandwidth and high latency. Current scheduling algorithms use
   multi-resolution data representation, priority determination and data
   prefetching algorithms to minimize these restrictions. Advanced priority
   determination and data prefetching methods for DVW applications use
   mathematic description of motion to predict next position of each
   individual user. These methods depend on the recent motion of a user so
   that they can accurately predict only near locations. In the case of
   sudden but regular changes in user motion direction (road networks) or
   fast moving user, these algorithms are not sufficient to predict future
   position with required accuracy and at required distances. In this paper
   we propose a systematic solution to scheduling of data transfer for DVW
   applications which uses next location prediction methods to compute
   download priority or additionally prefetch rendered data in advance.
   Experiments show that compared to motion functions the proposed
   scheduling scheme can increase data transfer efficiency and rendered
   image quality during scene exploration.

AB With the use of individual-level travel survey datasets describing the
   detailed activities of households, it is possible to analyze human
   movements with a high degree of precision. However, travel survey data
   are not without quality issues. Potential exists for origins and
   destinations of reported trips not to be geo-referenced, perhaps due to
   misreported information or inconsistencies in spatial address databases,
   which can limit the usefulness of the survey data. From an analytical
   standpoint, this is a serious problem because a single unreferenced stop
   in a trip record in effect renders that individual's data useless,
   especially in cases where analyzing chains of activity locations is of
   interest. This paper presents a framework and basic computational
   approach for exploring unlocatable activity locations inherent to travel
   surveys. Derived from recent work in developing a network-based,
   probabilistic time geography, the proposed methods are able to estimate
   the likely locations of missing trip origins and destinations. The
   methods generate probabilistic potential path trees which are used to
   visualize and quantify potential locations for the unreferenced
   destinations. The methods are demonstrated with simulated survey data
   from a smaller metropolitan area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   significant progress and is attracting growing attention in a number of
   disciplines and application domains. However, there is a lack of
   high-level overview on this topic that can inform related communities of
   the research state of the art. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
   survey to examine the development and current status of various aspects
   of sensor-based activity recognition. We first discuss the general
   rationale and distinctions of vision-based and sensor-based activity
   recognition. Then, we review the major approaches and methods associated
   with sensor-based activity monitoring, modeling, and recognition from
   which strengths and weaknesses of those approaches are highlighted. We
   make a primary distinction in this paper between data-driven and
   knowledge-driven approaches, and use this distinction to structure our
   survey. We also discuss some promising directions for future research.

AB Modern technology has brought many changes to our everyday lives. Our
   need to be in constant touch with others has been met with the
   cellphone, which has become our companion and the convergence point of
   many technological advances. The combination of capabilities such as
   browsing the Internet and GPS reception has multiplied the services and
   applications based on the current location of the user. However,
   providing the user with these services has certain drawbacks. Although
   map navigation systems are the most meaningful way of displaying this
   information, the user still has to manually set up the filter in order
   to obtain a non-bloated visualization of the map and the available
   services. To tackle this problem, we present here a semantic
   multicriteria ant colony algorithm capable of learning the user's
   routes, including associated context information, and then predicting
   the most likely route a user is following, given his current location
   and context data. This knowledge could then be used as the basis for
   offering services related to his current (or most likely future) context
   data close to the path he is following. Our experimental results show
   that our algorithm is capable of obtaining consistent solutions sets
   even when multiple objective ontological terms are included in the
   process. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Predicting users' next location allows to anticipate their future

   (LZ, LeZi Update and Active LeZi) capable of learning mobility patterns
   and estimating the next location with low resource needs, which makes it
   possible to execute them on mobile devices. The original algorithms have
   been divided into two phases, thus being possible to mix them and check
   which combination is the best one to obtain better prediction accuracy
   or lower resource consumption. To make such comparisons, a set of
   GSM-based mobility traces of 95 different users is considered. Finally,
   a prototype for mobile devices that integrates the predictors in a
   public transportation recommender system is described in order to show
   an example of how to take advantage of location prediction in an
   ubiquitous computing environment.

AB Planning travel to unfamiliar regions is a difficult task for novice
   travelers. The burden can be eased if the resident of the area offers to
   help. In this paper, we propose a social itinerary recommendation by
   learning from multiple user-generated digital trails, such as GPS
   trajectories of residents and travel experts. In order to recommend
   satisfying itinerary to users, we present an itinerary model in terms of
   attributes extracted from user-generated GPS trajectories. On top of
   this itinerary model, we present a social itinerary recommendation
   framework to find and rank itinerary candidates. We evaluated the
   efficiency of our recommendation method against baseline algorithms with
   a large set of user-generated GPS trajectories collected from Beijing,
   China. First, systematically generated user queries are used to compare
   the recommendation performance in the algorithmic level. Second, a user
   study involving current residents of Beijing is conducted to compare
   user perception and satisfaction on the recommended itinerary. Third, we
   compare mobile-only approach with Mobile+Cloud architecture for
   practical mobile recommender deployment. Lastly, we discuss
   personalization and adaptation factors in social itinerary
   recommendation throughout the paper.

   for the ambiguity of hand motions, (2) the use of motion data to
   compensate for the slow sampling rate and unreliable signal of the low
   cost ultrasonic positioning system, and (3) an incremental, multistage

AB Using GPS trajectories to recommend pick-up points for taxi driver comes
   to be a promising approach of increasing profits and decreasing
   pollutions. In the existing methods, nearly all the GPS data of a city
   are computed for recommendation. However, it is time-consuming and not
   accurate enough owing to too much spatio-temporal noise. Therefore, we
   propose a novel method of recommending pick-up for taxi driver based on
   spatio-temporal clustering. It is made up of data preprocessing and
   real-time recommendation. Firstly, we capture the historical pick-up
   points by analyzing their intervals. These points are clustered at
   different time and different regions to create - candidate pick-up
   points. Secondly, after ranking the candidate pick-up points around the
   taxi, the top-5 valuable pick-up points are recommended for taxi
   drivers. The experimental results, whose data come from Microsoft
   Research Asia, show that our method can effectively recommend pick-up
   points for taxi drivers.

AB Route prediction is important to analyzing and understanding the route
   patterns and behavior of traffic crowds. Its objective is to predict the
   most likely or "popular" route of road segments from a given point in a
   road network. This paper presents a hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric
   approach to efficient and scalable route prediction that can harness the
   wisdom of crowds of route planning agents by aggregating their
   sequential routes of possibly varying lengths and origin-destination
   pairs. In particular, our approach has the advantages of (a) not
   requiring a Markov assumption to be imposed and (b) generalizing well
   with sparse data, thus resulting in significantly improved prediction
   accuracy, as demonstrated empirically using real-world taxi route data.
   We also show two practical applications of our route prediction
   algorithm: predictive taxi ranking and route recommendation.

AB This contribution discusses an approach on finding significant locations
   from a set of GPS tracks, called Hotspots in this contribution. Based on
   that, a model where traffic infrastructure is represented by a dynamic
   network of Hotspots is suggested. Besides the location of Hotspots,
   information about travel times between these Hotspot-Nodes also comes
   along with the extracted significant places. This information can be
   used to improve or enrich traffic management and/or navigation systems
   by consequently achieving a more precise estimation of travel times
   compared to current systems.

AB With rapid growth of the GPS enabled mobile device, location-based
   online social network services become more and more popular, and allow
   their users to share life experiences with location information. In this
   paper, we considered a method for recommending places to a user based on
   spatial databases of location-based online social network services. We
   used a user-based collaborative filtering method to make a set of
   recommended places. In the proposed method, we calculate similarity of
   users' check-in activities not only their positions but also their
   semantics such as "shopping", "eating", "drinking", and so forth. We
   empirically evaluated our method in a real database and found that it
   outperforms the naive singular value decomposition collaborative
   filtering recommendation by comparing the prediction accuracy.

AB Recent research has shown that surprisingly rich models of human
   activity can be learned from GPS (positional) data. However, most effort
   to date has concentrated on modeling single individuals or statistical
   properties of groups of people. Moreover, prior work focused solely on
   modeling actual successful executions (and not failed or attempted
   executions) of the activities of interest. We, in contrast, take on the
   task of understanding human interactions, attempted interactions, and
   intentions from noisy sensor data in a fully relational multi-agent
   setting. We use a real-world game of capture the flag to illustrate our
   approach in a well-defined domain that involves many distinct
   cooperative and competitive joint activities. We model the domain using
   Markov logic, a statistical-relational language, and learn a theory that
   jointly denoises the data and infers occurrences of high-level
   activities, such as a player capturing an enemy. Our unified model
   combines constraints imposed by the geometry of the game area, the
   motion model of the players, and by the rules and dynamics of the game
   in a probabilistically and logically sound fashion. We show that while
   it may be impossible to directly detect a multi-agent activity due to
   sensor noise or malfunction, the occurrence of the activity can still be
   inferred by considering both its impact on the future behaviors of the
   people involved as well as the events that could have preceded it.
   Further, we show that given a model of successfully performed
   multi-agent activities, along with a set of examples of failed attempts
   at the same activities, our system automatically learns an augmented
   model that is capable of recognizing success and failure, as well as
   goals of people's actions with high accuracy. We compare our approach
   with other alternatives and show that our unified model, which takes
   into account not only relationships among individual players, but also
   relationships among activities over the entire length of a game,
   although more computationally costly, is significantly more accurate.
   Finally, we demonstrate that explicitly modeling unsuccessful attempts
   boosts performance on other important recognition tasks.

AB The number of mobile Internet users is growing rapidly, as well as the
   capability of mobile Internet devices. As a result, the enormous amount
   of traffic generated everyday on mobile Internet is pushing cellular
   services to their limits. We see great potential in the idea of
   scheduling the transmission of delay tolerant data towards times when
   the network condition is better. However, such scheduling requires good
   network condition prediction, which has not been effectively tackled in
   previous research. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Hidden Markov
   Model (DHMM) to model the time dependent and location dependent network
   conditions observed by individual users. The model is dynamic since
   transition matrix and states are updated when new observations are
   available. On the other hand, it has all the properties of a Hidden
   Markov Model. DHMM can predict precisely the next state given the
   current state, hence can provide a good prediction of network condition.
   DHMM has two layers, the top layer is Received Signal Strength (RSS) and
   the bottom layer consists of states, defined as a mixture of location,
   time and the signal strength itself. Since the state is defined as a
   mixture, it is hidden and the number of states is also not known a
   priori. Thus, the Nonparametric Bayesian Classification is applied to
   determine the hidden states. We show through simulations that when
   combined with a Markov decision process, the opportunistic scheduling
   can reduce transmission costs up to 50.34% compared with a naive
   approach.

AB The most difficult-and often most essential-aspect of many interception
   and tracking tasks is constructing motion models of the targets. Experts
   rarely can provide complete information about a target's expected motion
   pattern, and fitting parameters for complex motion patterns can require
   large amounts of training data. Specifying how to parameterize complex
   motion patterns is in itself a difficult task.
   In contrast, Bayesian nonparametric models of target motion are very
   flexible and generalize well with relatively little training data. We
   propose modeling target motion patterns as a mixture of Gaussian
   processes (GP) with a Dirichlet process (DP) prior over mixture weights.
   The GP provides an adaptive representation for each individual motion
   pattern, while the DP prior allows us to represent an unknown number of
   motion patterns. Both automatically adjust the complexity of the motion
   model based on the available data. Our approach outperforms several
   parametric models on a helicopter-based car-tracking task on data
   collected from the greater Boston area.

   trajectory data. Route patterns are extracted from personal trajectory
   data using a novel mining algorithm, Continuous Route Pattern Mining
   (CRPM), which can tolerate different kinds of disturbance in trajectory
   data. Furthermore, a client-server architecture is employed which has
   the dual purpose of guaranteeing the privacy of personal data and
   greatly reducing the computational load on mobile devices. An evaluation
   using a corpus of trajectory data from 17 people demonstrates that CRPM
   can extract longer route patterns than current methods. Moreover, the
   average correct rate of one step prediction of our system is greater
   than 71%, and the average Levenshtein distance of continuous route
   prediction of our system is about 30% shorter than that of the Markov
   model based method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Over the last few years, electronic vehicle guidance systems have become
   increasingly more popular. However, despite their ubiquity, performance
   will always be subject to availability of detailed digital road maps.
   Most current digital maps are still inadequate for advanced applications
   in unstructured environments. Lack of up-to-date information and
   insufficient refinement of the road geometry are among the most
   important shortcomings. The massive use of inexpensive Global
   Positioning System (GPS) receivers, combined with the rapidly increasing
   availability of wireless communication infrastructure, suggests that
   large amounts of data combining both modalities will be available in the
   near future. The approach presented here draws on machine-learning
   techniques and processes logs of position traces to consistently build a
   detailed and fine-grained representation of the road network by
   extracting the principal paths followed by the vehicles. Although this
   work addresses the road-building problem in dynamic environments such as
   open-pit mines, it is also applicable to urban environments. New
   contributions include a fully unsupervised segmentation method for
   sampling roads and inferring the network topology, which is a general
   technique for extracting detailed information about road splits, merges,
   and intersections, as well as a robust algorithm that articulates these
   two. Experimental results with data from large mining operations are
   presented to validate the new algorithm.

AB There is growing interest in the ways in which the location of a person
   can be utilized by new applications and services. Recent advances in
   mobile technologies have meant that the technical capability to record
   and transmit location data for processing is appearing in off-the-shelf
   handsets. This opens possibilities to profile people based on the places
   they visit, people they associate with, or other aspects of their
   complex routines determined through persistent tracking. It is possible
   that services offering customized information based on the results of
   such behavioral profiling could become commonplace. However, it may not
   be immediately apparent to the user that a wealth of information about
   them, potentially unrelated to the service, can be revealed. Further
   issues occur if the user agreed, while subscribing to the service, for
   data to be passed to third parties where it may be used to their
   detriment. Here, we report in detail on a short case study tracking four
   people, in three European member states, persistently for six weeks
   using mobile handsets. The GPS locations of these people have been mined
   to reveal places of interest and to create simple profiles. The
   information drawn from the profiling activity ranges from intuitive
   through special cases to insightful. In this paper, these results and
   further extensions to the technology are considered in light of European
   legislation to assess the privacy implications of this emerging
   technology.

AB To setup efficient wireless mesh networks, it is fundamental to limit
   the overhead needed to localize a mobile user. A promising approach is
   to rely on a rendezvous-based location system where the current location
   of a mobile node is stored at specific nodes called locators.
   Nevertheless, such a solution has a drawback, which happens when the
   locator is far from the source-destination shortest path. This results
   in a triangular location problem and consequently in increased overhead
   of signaling messages. One solution to prevent this problem would be to
   place the locator as close as possible to the mobile node. This requires
   however to predict the mobile node's location at all times. To obtain
   such information, we define a mobility prediction model (an agenda)
   that, for each node, specifies the mesh router that is likely to be the
   closest to the mobile node at specific time periods. The location
   service that we propose formalizes the integration of the agenda with
   the management of location servers in a coherent and self-organized
   fashion. To evaluate the performance of our system compared to
   traditional approaches, we use two real-life mobility datasets of Wi-Fi
   devices in the Dartmouth campus and Taxicabs in the bay area of San
   Francisco. We show that our strategy significantly outperforms
   traditional solutions; we obtain gains ranging from 39 to 72% compared
   to the centralized scheme and more than 35% compared to a traditional
   rendezvous-based solution.

AB The increasing availability of location-acquisition technologies (GPS,
   GSM networks, etc.) enables people to log the location histories with
   spatio-temporal data. Such real-world location histories imply, to some
   extent, users' interests in places, and bring us opportunities to
   understand the correlation between users and locations. In this article,
   we move towards this direction and report on a personalized friend and
   location recommender for the geographical information systems (GIS) on
   the Web. First, in this recommender system, a particular individual's
   visits to a geospatial region in the real world are used as their
   implicit ratings on that region. Second, we measure the similarity
   between users in terms of their location histories and recommend to each
   user a group of potential friends in a GIS community. Third, we estimate
   an individual's interests in a set of unvisited regions by involving
   his/her location history and those of other users. Some unvisited
   locations that might match their tastes can be recommended to the
   individual. A framework, referred to as a hierarchical-graph-based
   similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed to uniformly model each
   individual's location history, and effectively measure the similarity
   among users. In this framework, we take into account three factors: 1)
   the sequence property of people's outdoor movements, 2) the visited
   popularity of a geospatial region, and 3) the hierarchical property of
   geographic spaces. Further, we incorporated a content-based method into
   a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, which uses HGSM as the
   user similarity measure, to estimate the rating of a user on an item. We
   evaluated this recommender system based on the GPS data collected by 75
   subjects over a period of 1 year in the real world. As a result, HGSM
   outperforms related similarity measures, namely similarity-by-count,
   cosine similarity, and Pearson similarity measures. Moreover, beyond the
   item-based CF method and random recommendations, our system provides
   users with more attractive locations and better user experiences of
   recommendation.

AB In this paper we analyze a class of location disclosure in which
   location information from individuals is generated in an automated way,
   i.e. is observed by a ubiquitous infrastructure. Since such information
   is valuable for both scientific research and commercial use, location
   information might be passed on to third parties. Users are usually aware
   neither of the extent of the information disclosure (e.g. by carrying a
   mobile phone), nor how the collected data is used and by whom.
   In order to assess the expected privacy risk in terms of the possible
   extent of exposure, we propose an adversary model and a privacy metric
   that allow an evaluation of the possible privacy loss by using mobile
   communication infrastructure. Furthermore, a case study on the privacy
   effects of using GSM infrastructure was conducted with the goal of
   analyzing the side effects of using a mobile handset. Based on these
   results requirements for a privacy-aware mobile handheld device were

AB Virtual world user models have similarities with hypertext system user
   models. User knowledge and preferences may be derived from the locations
   users visit or recommend. The models can represent topics of interest
   for the user based on the subject or content of visited locations, and
   corresponding location models can enable matching between users and
   locations. However, virtual worlds also present challenges and
   opportunities that differ from hypertext worlds. Content collection for
   a cross-world search and recommendation service may be more difficult in
   virtual worlds, and there is less text available for analysis. In some
   cases, though, extra information is available to add to user and content
   profiles enhance the matching ability of the system. In this paper, we
   present a content collection system for Second Life and OpenSimulator
   virtual worlds, as well as user and location models derived from the
   collected content. The models incorporate text, social proximity, and
   metadata attributes to create hybrid user models for representing user
   interests and preferences. The models are evaluated based on their
   ability to match content popularity and observed user behavior.

AB Many potential pervasive computing applications could use predictions of
   when a person will be at a certain place. Using a survey and GPS data
   from 34 participants in 11 households, we develop and test algorithms
   for predicting when a person will be at home or away. We show that our
   participants' self-reported home/away schedules are not very accurate,
   and we introduce a probabilistic home/away schedule computed from
   observed GPS data. The computation includes smoothing and a soft
   schedule template. We show how the probabilistic schedule outperforms
   both the self-reported schedule and an algorithm based on driving time.
   We also show how to combine our algorithm with the best part of the
   drive time algorithm for a slight boost in performance.

AB As location-sensing smart phones and location-based services gain
   mainstream popularity, there is increased interest in developing
   techniques that can detect anomalous activities. Anomaly detection
   capabilities can be used in theft detection, remote elder-care
   monitoring systems, and many other applications. In this paper we
   present an n-gram based model for modeling a user's mobility patterns.
   Under the Markovian assumption that a user's location at time t depends
   only on the last n - 1 locations until t - 1, we can model a user's
   idiosyncratic location patterns through a collection of n-gram
   geo-labels, each with estimated probabilities. We present extensive
   evaluations of the n-gram model conducted on real-world data, compare it
   with the previous approaches of using T-Patterns and Markovian models,
   and show that for anomaly detection the n-gram model outperforms
   existing work by approximately 10%. We also show that the model can use
   a hierarchical location partitioning system that is able to obscure a
   user's exact location, to protect privacy, while still allowing
   applications to utilize the obscured location data for modeling
   anomalies effectively.

AB Accurate and fine-grained prediction of future user location and
   geographical profile has interesting and promising applications
   including targeted content service, advertisement dissemination for
   mobile users, and recreational social networking tools for smart-phones.
   Existing techniques based on linear and probabilistic models are not
   able to provide accurate prediction of the location patterns from a
   spatio-temporal perspective, especially for long-term estimation. More
   specifically, they are able to only forecast the next location of a
   user, but not his/her arrival time and residence time, i.e., the
   interval of time spent in that location. Moreover, these techniques are
   often based on prediction models that are not able to extend predictions
   further in the future.
   In this paper we present NextPlace, a novel approach to location
   prediction based on nonlinear time series analysis of the arrival and
   residence times of users in relevant places. NextPlace focuses on the
   predictability of single users when they visit their most important
   places, rather than on the transitions between different locations. We
   report about our evaluation using four different datasets and we compare
   our forecasting results to those obtained by means of the prediction
   techniques proposed in the literature. We show how we achieve higher
   performance compared to other predictors and also more stability over
   time, with an overall prediction precision of up to 90% and a
   performance increment of at least 50% with respect to the state of the
   art.

AB Location and tracking of healthy or infirm elders is a potentially
   useful application as society aging is accelerating worldwide and as
   technologies such as cellular positioning and Assisted Global

   in such an application, the battery operating hour is often a key

   AGPS tracking algorithm based on the concept of Personal Common Location
   (PCL) that we define as the locations at which an elder spends most of
   his/her time, as recognized from historic cell ID record. During the
   tracking process, AGPS fixes are avoided if the elderly carrier is
   determined to be located within a PCL, if the destination PCL can be
   predicted, or if AGPS signals are likely to be unavailable. This paper
   also describes our approach for off-line PCL recognition, the necessity
   of cell ID clustering, as well as the results from our tracking
   experiments.

AB Advanced GIS applications and GPS loggers allow travelers to record
   their own tracks and later examine, modify and share them. Searching for
   the areas of interest, AOIs, however, is often not an easy task,
   especially with long routes. This paper proposes a system for inferring
   and focusing AOls, from a UPS trace. The proposed system consists of
   three main functions: fragmentation, defragmentation, and focusing. The
   fragmentation detects the changes of the travelling pace and decomposes
   the GPS trace into a large number of small fragments according the
   traveling pace while the defragmentation composes adjacent fragments
   into one fragment which is inside the AOI. The focusing provides a
   Focus+Context+Glue map where the Focus is an area of a large-scale map
   including the AOI that enables users to understand details of the AOI.
   We have developed a prototype of the proposed method that includes the
   above features and evaluated the feasibility and advantages of the
   proposed system.

AB The main goals of today's wireless mobile telecommunication systems are

   MT to be connected to the network anytime, anywhere, regardless of the
   access channel's characteristics. In this chapter we deal with mobility
   aspects. We provide some basic background on mobility models that are
   being used in performance evaluation of relevant mobility management
   procedures, such as handover and location update. For handover, and
   consequently for channel holding time. we revisit the characterization
   of the cell residence time. Then, based on those previous results,
   models for the location area residence time are built. Cell residence
   time can be seen as a micro-mobility parameter while the latter can be
   considered as a macro-mobility parameter; and both have a significant
   impact on the handover and location update algorithms.

   prediction for optimizing their charging and discharging phases. In this
   paper, a new lightweight route recognition approach using instance-based

   in real-time against the route instances observed in past, and the most
   similar route is selected. In order to assess the similarity between the
   routes, a similarity measure based on the longest common subsequence
   (LCSS) is employed, and an algorithm for incrementally evaluating the
   LCSS is introduced. The feasibility of the proposed approach is
   empirically evaluated using real-world data; the obtained results
   indicate that the routes can be accurately recognized with a delay of 11
   turn-points.

AB The advance of GPS-enabled devices allows people to record their
   location histories with GPS traces, which imply human behaviors and
   preferences related to travel. In this article, we perform two types of
   travel recommendations by mining multiple users' GPS traces. The first
   is a generic one that recommends a user with top interesting locations
   and travel sequences in a given geospatial region. The second is a
   personalized recommendation that provides an individual with locations
   matching her travel preferences. To achieve the first recommendation, we
   model multiple users' location histories with a tree-based hierarchical
   graph (TBHG). Based on the TBHG, we propose a HITS (Hypertext Induced
   Topic Search)-based model to infer the interest level of a location and
   a user's travel experience (knowledge). In the personalized
   recommendation, we first understand the correlation between locations,
   and then incorporate this correlation into a collaborative filtering
   (CF)-based model, which predicts a user's interests in an unvisited
   location based on her locations histories and that of others. We
   evaluated our system based on a real-world GPS trace dataset collected
   by 107 users over a period of one year. As a result, our HITS-based
   inference model outperformed baseline approaches like rank-by-count and
   rank-by-frequency. Meanwhile, we achieved a better performance in
   recommending travel sequences beyond baselines like rank-by-count.
   Regarding the personalized recommendation, our approach is more
   effective than the weighted Slope One algorithm with a slightly
   additional computation, and is more efficient than the Pearson
   correlation-based CF model with the similar effectiveness.

AB Modern technology has brought many changes to our everyday lives. Our
   need to be in constant touch with others has been met with the
   cellphone, which has become our companion and the convergence point of
   many technological advances. The combination of capabilities such as
   browsing the Internet and GPS reception has multiplied the services and
   applications based on the current location of the user. However,
   providing the user with these services has certain drawbacks. Although
   map navigation systems are the most meaningful way of displaying this
   information, the user still has to manually set up the filter in order
   to obtain a non-bloated visualization of the map and the available
   services. To tackle this problem, we present here a semantic
   multicriteria ant colony algorithm capable of learning the user's
   routes, including associated context information, and then predicting
   the most likely route a user is following, given his current location
   and context data. We also propose an affective component for the
   algorithm that will add a value to routes likelihood score so it will
   emphasize those predicted routes that could affect positively user
   experience or emotional state. This knowledge could then be used as the
   basis for offering services related to his current ( or most likely
   future) context data close to the path he is following.

AB Location is a key context ingredient and many existing pervasive
   applications rely on the current locations of their users. However, with
   the ability to predict the future location and movement behavior of a
   user, the usability of these applications can be greatly improved. In
   this paper, we propose an approach to predict both the intended
   destination and the future route of a person. Rather than predicting the
   destination and future route separately, we have focused on making
   prediction in an integrated way by exploiting personal movement data
   (i.e. trajectories) collected by GPS. Since trajectories contain daily
   whereabouts information of a person, the proposed approach first detects
   the significant places where the person may depart from or go to using a
   clustering-based algorithm called FBM (Forward Backward Matching), then
   abstracts the trajectories based on a space partitioning method, and
   finally extracts movement patterns from the abstracted trajectories
   using an extended CRPM (Continuous Route Pattern Mining) algorithm.
   Extracted movement patterns are organized in terms of origin-destination
   couples. The prediction is made based on a pattern tree built from these
   movement patterns. With the real personal movement data of 14
   participants, we conducted a number of experiments to evaluate the
   performance of our system. The results show that our approach can
   achieve approximately 80% and 60% accuracy in destination prediction and
   1-step prediction, respectively, and result in an average deviation of
   approximately 60 m in continuous future route prediction. Finally, based
   on the proposed approach, we implemented a prototype running on mobile
   phones, which can extract patterns from a user's historical movement
   data and predict the destination and future route. (C) 2010 Elsevier

AB Recognizing high-level human behavior and decisions from their digital
   traces are critical issues in pervasive computing systems. In this
   paper, we develop a novel methodology to reveal cabdrivers' operation
   patterns by analyzing their continuous digital traces. For the first
   time, we systematically study large scale cabdrivers' behavior in a real
   and complex city context through their daily digital traces. We identify
   a set of valuable features, which are simple and effective to classify
   cabdrivers, delineate cabdrivers' operation patterns and compare the
   different cabdrivers' behavior. The methodology and steps could
   spatially and temporally quantify, visualize, and examine different
   cabdrivers' operation patterns. Drivers were categorized into top
   drivers and ordinary drivers by their daily income. We use the daily
   operations of 3000 cabdrivers in over 48 million of trips and 240
   million kilometers to uncover: (1) spatial selection behavior, (2)
   context-aware spatio-temporal operation behavior, (3) route choice
   behavior, and (4) operation tactics. Though we focused on cabdriver
   operation patterns analysis from their digital traces, the methodology
   is a general empirical and analytical methodology for any GPS-like trace
   analysis. Our work demonstrates the great potential to utilize the
   massive pervasive data sets to understand human behavior and high-level
   intelligence. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   measurements into a monocular simultaneous localization and mapping
   process, which routinely uses 2D image measurements to acquire and
   maintain a map of the surroundings, irrespective of whether objects are

AB Mobility path information of cell phone users play a crucial role in a
   wide range of cell phone applications, including context based search
   and advertising, early warning systems, city-wide sensing applications
   such as air pollution exposure estimation and traffic planning. However,
   there is a disconnect between the low level location data logs available
   from the cell phones and the high level mobility path information
   required to support these cell phone applications. In this paper, we
   present formal definitions to capture the cell phone users' mobility
   patterns and profiles, and provide a complete framework, Mobility
   Profiler, for discovering mobile cell phone user profiles starting from
   cell based location data. We use real-world cell phone log data (of over
   350 K h of coverage) to demonstrate our framework and perform
   experiments for discovering frequent mobility patterns and profiles. Our
   analysis of mobility profiles of cell phone users expose a significant
   long tail in a user's location-time distribution: A total of 15% of a
   cell phone user's time is spent on average in locations that each
   appears with less than 1% of total time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Pervasive computing creates possibilities for presenting highly
   personalised information about the people, places and things in a
   building. One of the challenges for such personalisation is the creation
   of the system that can support ontological reasoning for several key
   tasks: reasoning about location; personalisation of information about
   location at the right level of detail; and personalisation to match each
   person's conceptions of the building based on their own use of it and
   their relationship to other people in the building. From pragmatic
   perspectives, it should be inexpensive to create the ontology for each
   new building. It is also critical that users should be able to
   understand and control pervasive applications. We created the PERSONAF
   (personalised pervasive scrutable ontological framework) to address
   these challenges. PERSONAF is a new abstract framework for pervasive
   ontological reasoning. We report its evaluation at three levels. First,
   we assessed the power of the ontology for reasoning about noisy and
   uncertain location information, showing that PERSONAF can improve
   location modelling. Notably, the best ontological reasoner varies across
   users. Second, we demonstrate the use of the PERSONAF framework in
   Adaptive Locator, an application built upon it, using our low cost
   mechanisms for non-generic layers of the ontology. Finally, we report a
   user study, which evaluated the PERSONAF approach as seen by users in
   the Adaptive Locator. We assessed both the personalisation performance
   and the understandability of explanations of the system reasoning.
   Together, these three evaluations show that the PERSONAF approach
   supports building of low cost ontologies, that can achieve flexible
   ontological reasoning about smart buildings and the people in them, and
   that this can be used to build applications which give personalised
   information that can provide understandable explanations of the
   reasoning underlying the personalisation.
